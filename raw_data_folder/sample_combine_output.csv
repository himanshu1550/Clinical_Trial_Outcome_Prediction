1,NCT03171714,Derma-Stent Novel Abscess Packing Device,Derma-Stent Novel Abscess Packing Device (Pilot Study),"Aaron Brody, MD, MPH",Other,Mar-Med,"
      In this research study, a device called the Derma-Stent will be tested. The sponsor of the
      study, Mar-Med Company, will supply the device. This device is used to drain a cutaneous
      abscess, which is a skin infection that results in buildup of pus under the skin. Currently,
      the normal treatment for this abscess is to cut and drain and the wound, and later pack the
      wound with gauze. Packing is done to prevent the pus to accumulate again. But regular gauze
      is difficult for patient to remove themselves, so another visit to the doctor is usually
      necessary. The Derma-Stent device will be tested to see how easily patients can remove this
      by themselves and if it is less painful and more effective than normal gauze packing.
    ","
      Background:

      Cutaneous abscess is an infectious condition that affects millions of people each year, and
      the incidence is on the rise. Between 1993 and 2005, the annual number of emergency
      department (ED) visits for skin and soft tissue infections increased from 1.2 to 3.4 million,
      and this largely attributed to a rise in the prevalence of Methicillin Resistant
      Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) in the community.

      The standard treatment for cutaneous abscess is incision and drainage at bedside in the ED.
      Following this procedure, many clinicians insert a strip of gauze, known as packing, to
      maintain the open surgical incision, enhance drainage, and prevent re-accumulation of the
      abscess. If the abscess is packed, patients typically have to return in 2-3 days for a repeat
      visit to have the packing removed. The present standard of care, gauze packing, is difficult
      for patients to remove alone, as the packing itself becomes impregnated with pus and blood.
      Additionally, the packing procedure can be painful, despite the use of local anesthetics.

      A newer approach advocates for the use of a silicon string, known as a PDS loop for purposes
      of packing and drainage. While this approach can reduce pain, and is equally effective in
      terms of healing time, and treatment failure, the PDS, or Vessiloop is not readily available
      in emergency departments and outpatient clinics, as it is a specialized sterile surgical
      device used in vascular procedures. Furthermore, this procedure does not facilitate
      irrigation of the abscess cavity, since a much smaller incision is made. Finally, the PDS
      loop requires a surgical knot which may come loose.

      Objective:

      To investigate the use of a novel silicon packing device, the Derma-Stentâ„¢. The novel device
      will facilitate self removal by patients, as it has a narrower profile, and, as a
      nonabsorbent material, will not become saturated with bodily fluids. Although it will not
      absorb body fluids, it is believed that the Derma-stent will achieve the objective of wound
      healing by maintaining the opening of the surgical incision.

      Hypothesis:

      The acceptability of self removal will be significantly higher for the novel device.

      Study Protocol:

      ED Visit

        1. Abscess measured by ultrasound. Study will be performed by a trained research assistant,
           and will be verified by a physician certified to interpret soft tissue sonographic
           images.

        2. Abscess photographed, with measurement tape, to allow for objective measurement of skin
           induration and erythema.

        3. Abscess will be incised and drained, utilizing standard of care technique, with local
           anesthetic

        4. Packing performed according to randomization group.

        5. Sterile dressing applied.

        6. Subject completes assessment form - pain scale.

        7. Practitioner fills out assessment form - ease of use.

      Follow up visit 1 - 3-5 days

        1. Removal of packing. Subjects will be asked to remove packing on their own under
           supervision of the physician. Physician will remove the packing if they not able to.

        2. Measurement of abscess diameter and volume, utilizing measuring tape, photograph, and
           point of care ultrasound.

        3. Practitioner and subject assessment form as above, but adding ease of procedure, and
           likelihood that subject would have removed packing at home.

      Follow up visit 2 - 24-32 days

        1. Assessment of residual erythema and fluid collection by measurement, photograph, and US

        2. Practitioner and subject assessment including global satisfaction, and satisfaction with
           cosmetic result.

      Adverse Effects:

      If physician is impressed that the wound is not appropriately at either f/u visit,
      antibiotics may be prescribed, and repacking may be performed, utilizing gauze packing strip.
      Use of antibiotics for abscess is controversial and most physicians prescribe these on a case
      by case basis. Antibiotics will be prescribed at the discretion of the physician and not
      related to the study protocol.

      Population:

      Convenience sample of adult patients presenting with uncomplicated cutaneous abscess amenable
      to bedside drainage to either DRH or SGH ED.

      Sample size calculation:

      As this is a hypothesis generating study, and the effect size is unknown, formal sample size
      calculation was not performed. 60 patients was chosen as the sample size.

      Diagnosis of extra pulmonary tuberculosis remains especially challenging since the number of
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli present in tissues at sites of disease is often low and
      clinical specimens from deep-seated organs may be difficult to obtain. Histology is
      time-consuming to undertake and establishing a diagnosis of tuberculosis with high
      specificity remains difficult. Tissue microscopy after special staining is often negative and
      when mycobacteria are seen, it is impossible to distinguish Mycobacterium tuberculosis from
      non tuberculous mycobacterial disease. Reliance on culture, the mainstay of diagnosis, often
      leads to considerable delays, compromising patient care and outcomes.

      Evidence from 138 studies published before 2008 suggested that nucleic acid amplification
      technologies could not replace conventional mycobacterial tests (microscopy, culture) for
      diagnosing pulmonary and, especially, extra pulmonary tuberculosis
    ","
      Only a few years later, GeneXpert technology has changed this paradigm, with a recent
      systematic review showing pooled sensitivity of 88% and pooled specificity of 98% for
      diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis, but evidence (as of March 2012) for using Xpert MTB/RIF
      for diagnosing extra pulmonary tuberculosis is still comparatively weak Globally, there is
      still a dearth of studies involving the use of Xpert MTB/RIF in extra pulmonary tuberculosis
      specimens, and few provide definitive answers. This is due mostly to the studies having small
      sample sizes across a range of various specimen types and differences in pre-processing
      methodologies and in input volumes and to studies having been conducted in different
      populations (adults, children, Human immunodeficiency virus infected).

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of a mobile-phone based
      contingency management (CM) intervention for smoking in low-SES women. The CM intervention
      will be combined with a Brief Motivational Interviewing (BMI) counseling component. This
      study will examine the following research aims:

      Primary Aim: To compare the effects of a Brief Motivational Intervention (BMI) + mobile
      phone-based CM on tobacco use when compared to BMI with a non-contingent control condition in
      a small feasibility trial.

      Hypothesis: The investigators expect women in the BMI + CM condition to have more smoke free
      days than women in the BMI + NC condition.

      Secondary Aim: To examine alcohol use as a moderator of cessation outcomes.
    ","
      Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, accounting
      for one out of every five deaths (CDC, 2012). In particular, smoking prevalence rates are
      high among socioeconomically-disadvantaged women; for example, over 40% of women with less
      than 12 yrs education smoke, compared to 28% and 16% among those with some college and
      undergraduate degrees (SAMHSA, 2010). Smoking cessation rates are particularly low among
      low-SES women with co-occurring alcohol use disorders, and these substances are frequently
      used together (Kahler et al., 2010; Businelle et al., 2013). Therefore, interventions that
      reduce both alcohol and smoking among heavy alcohol-using women are vitally needed to reduce
      rates of smoking-related morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable population.

      Counseling approaches that incorporate problem solving, skills training and social support
      are effective for reducing smoking in the general population (Fiore et al., 2008). However,
      given the high rates of smoking among alcohol-using women, they may be inadequate for in this
      population. Contingency management (CM) interventions, which provide tangible reinforcers
      contingent upon smoking abstinence or reduction to a criterion level, are highly-efficacious
      interventions for reducing cigarette smoking and other drug use in low-SES women (Higgins et
      al., 2012). Within the theoretical framework of operant conditioning, increasing the
      availability of an alternative reinforcer weakens the amount of control that the drug has
      over the user's behavior, especially when obtaining the alternative reinforcer is contingent
      on behaviors incompatible with drug use (Higgins, 1997). The tenets of CM interventions
      include (1) arranging the environment such that the target behavior can be readily and
      objectively detected, (2) providing a tangible reinforcer when the target behavior occurs,
      and (3) withholding reinforcement when the target behavior does not occur (Higgins et al.,
      1994).

      Although CM interventions clearly are effective at promoting smoking reductions, there are
      several challenges associated with translating CM into an effective clinical treatment for
      smoking. Perhaps the most significant challenge is the frequent monitoring necessary to
      objectively verify smoking abstinence using breath carbon monoxide (CO), the most convenient
      objective measure of smoking status. Because of the short half-life of CO (5-6 hours), CO
      levels must be measured at least twice per day in order to verify continuous abstinence.
      Recent CM-smoking studies have addressed this feasibility challenge by providing study
      participants with breath CO monitors and laptop computers or smartphones to use in their own
      natural environments (e.g., Dallery, Raiff & Grabinski, 2013). Participants are taught how to
      use their smartphones to text videos of themselves providing a breath CO level to a research
      staff member, twice per day. After the study staff has determined that the breath CO sample
      meets the abstinence criterion, participants are informed of the amount that they have earned
      for that sample.

      Given the high rates of smoking in low-SES women, investigating the additive impact of an
      in-person brief counseling intervention and a phone-based CM intervention is an important
      next step in examining effective methods to reduce the impact of smoking in this population.

      All the CRC patients from Research Center of Oncology will be examined with their written
      concent. Diagnosis of CRC is based on the results of clinical examination, endoscopic,
      histological, X-ray and laboratory data according to International Classification proposed by
      the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) with application TNM (T-tumor, N-nodus,
      M-metastases) for diagnosis. Descriptors in T (primary tumor) mean the degree of the tumor
      spreading in layers of the intestine; descriptors in N mean absence of metastases or the
      number of lymph nodes with metastases; descriptors in M shows absence or presence of remote
      metastases.

      The control group will be a random residents of Tashkent city without any complaints from
      gastrointestinal tract matched by gender and age to the patients with CRC. Age of individuals
      under examination will be taken at the range from 17 to 90 years old.

      Collection of stool samples Three stool samples for parasitological examination will be taken
      from both control subjects and CRC patients at 1-2 days interval. Stool samples were
      collected in individual containers, containing 5 ml of Turdiev's preservative provided
      conservation and staining of protozoa cysts and eggs of worms for a year. The Turdiev's
      preservative includes:80 ml of 0.2% aqueous solution of sodium nitrite, 10 ml of
      formaldehyde, 2 ml of glycerin, 8 ml of Lugol's solution, 250 ml of distilled water.

      Collection of material for C. parvum (Cryptosporidium parvum) detection in stool samples will
      be carried out by preparation of fresh feces thin smears.

      Stool samples examination Parasitological diagnosis will be performed by triple coproscopy
      using formalin - ethyl acetate concentration technique. For preparations staining Lugol's
      solution was used. The intensity of protozoa will be estimated by the number of protozoa in
      the field of view (ocular x10, objective x40), the number of protozoa will be calculated at
      least in 10 fields of view. 1-2, 3-4 and 5-6 microorganisms in a field of view were

      This phase II trial studies how well FASN inhibitor TVB-2640, paclitaxel, and trastuzumab
      work in treating patients with HER2 positive breast cancer that has spread to other places in
      the body (metastatic). FASN inhibitor TVB-2640 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Trastuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because
      it attaches itself to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as
      HER2 receptors. When trastuzumab attaches to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells
      to grow are blocked and the cancer cell may be marked for destruction by the body's immune
      system. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Drugs
      used in endocrine therapy either lower the amount of estrogen made by the body or blocks the
      use of estrogen by the tumor cells. This may help stop the growth of tumor cells that need
      estrogen to grow. Giving FASN inhibitor TVB-2640 and trastuzumab in combination with
      paclitaxel or endocrine therapy may help control the disease in patients with HER2 positive
      breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the overall tumor response rate (ORR i.e. complete response [CR]+partial
      response [PR]) of the combination of FASN inhibitor TVB-2640 [TVB-2640] with paclitaxel and
      trastuzumab in patients with taxane and trastuzumab-resistant, advanced HER2-positive breast
      cancer.

      II. To estimate the ORR of the combination of TVB-2640 with paclitaxel and trastuzumab in
      patients with taxane and trastuzumab-resistant, advanced HER2-positive breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. For each patient cohort, to evaluate the safety profile of the combination of TVB-2640
      with paclitaxel and trastuzumab.

      II. For each patient cohort, to assess the clinical benefit rate (CBR), duration of response,
      and progression free survival of the combination of TVB-2640 with paclitaxel and trastuzumab.

      III. To obtain a point and interval estimate of the difference in RR as well as the
      difference in CBR between cohort A and cohort B.

      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:

      I. For each patient cohort, to assess the changes in FASN, phosphorylation (p)AKT, and pS6
      expression in tumor tissue after the first cycle of the combination of TVB-2640 with
      paclitaxel and trastuzumab from pre-treatment levels.

      tissue after the first cycle of the combination of TVB-2640 with paclitaxel and trastuzumab
      from pre-treatment levels.

      III. For each patient cohort, to assess the changes in serum FASN after the first cycle of
      the combination of TVB-2640 with paclitaxel and trastuzumab from pre-treatment levels.

      This study seeks to evaluate, whether patients suffering from cardiac arrest, that can be
      successfully resuscitated, can be differentiated from those, that cannot be resuscitated,
      using arterial blood pressure values.
    ","
      Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in patients suffering from cardiac arrest out of
      hospitals is based on strict clinical practice guidelines. However, the evidence base for
      these treatment recommendation is insufficient in many respects. While knowledge about basic
      interventions, that are capable of restoring spontaneous circulation and improving
      neurologically intact survival - chest compressions, application of oxygen and early
      defibrillation -, has increased over the last decade, advanced treatment options - advanced
      airway management, vascular access, application of vasoactive drugs - are still recommended,
      although clinical trials of varying quality failed to demonstrate any benefit in patient
      related outcomes.

      This study seeks to establish hemodynamic threshold values that are able to discriminate
      between patients that achieve return of spontaneous circulation (survivors) and those that
      fail to do so (non-survivors). These cutoff values could act as targets for interventions
      during CPR (i.e. application of vasoactive drugs, use of mechanical compression devices, â€¦)
      in further trials and may potentially influence clinical practice later on. Furthermore,
      reliable cutoff values could act as additional prognostic factors during CPR, enabling
      prehospital care providers to base their decisions to continue or terminate ongoing CPR
      efforts on a more solid basis.

      To achieve this goal, 22 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) treated by
      physicians of the prehospital physician response system located at the Medical University of
      Graz shall be included into this trial. All patients will receive Advanced Life Support (ALS)
      interventions according to current guidelines issued by the European Resuscitation Council
      (ERC). In addition, arterial lines will be placed and arterial blood pressure will be
      measured continuously. This intervention is already considered standard of care at this
      prehospital physician response system and performed routinely as part of the local ALS
      algorithm.

      Relevant parameters - systolic arterial pressure (SAP), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP),
      mean arterial pressure (MAP) etc. - will be documented electronically using both the
      electronic documentation system already used by the prehospital physician response system and
      the monitor/defibrillator device. Median values will be compared between survivors and
      non-survivors and possible threshold values will be calculated. Cutoff values that would be
      best suited to act as targets in future research and clinical practice will be identified by
      receiver operating characteristics (ROC).

    ","
      Carotid artery stenosis is an important cause of stroke. Carotid artery stenting (CAS)
      provides non-inferior clinical outcome comparing to carotid endarterectomy (CEA). However,
      revascularization for carotid artery occlusion (CAO) remained controversial, owing to failed
      extracranial-to-intracranial (EC-IC) artery bypass trials, anatomical hindrance for CEA, and
      technical limitation for CAS. In the past 10 years, the investigators devoted in endovascular
      therapy for CAO and published innovative and pilot study results regarding feasibility of CAS
      for CAO, neurocognitive function (NCF) improvement after successful CAS for CAO, and
      predictors for CAS success in CAO, all in high-ranking journals. Moreover, successful CAS for
      CAO would lead to lower mortality and stroke rate during long-term follow-up, according to
      the preliminary analysis from the investigators. However, there is no prospective randomized
      control trial (RCT) regarding CAS in CAO patients, and in fact, most of the CAS trials
      excluded CAO.

      The investigators, with the largest volume and experience in CAO recanalization in the world,
      felt obliged and responsible to propose the following RCT to evaluate endovascular
      revascularization for chronic CAO.

      The study composed of two parts. The first part composed of prospective clinical registry for
      CAO. The second part compose of a prospective superiority trial, rater blinded, with 1:1
      randomization to evaluate the clinical efficacy of interventional therapy for CAO. Eligible
      candidates for CAO revealed by CT, ultrasonography, angiography, or magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI), with abnormal brain perfusion demonstrated by CT perfusion study (CTP) or MRI,
      will be enrolled in to study. If the participants agreed for randomization, participants will
      be randomized into 2 groups: the optimal medical therapy (OMT) group and the endovascular
      revascularization plus optimal medical therapy (ER+OMT) group. The primary end-point of the
      trial is the NCF improvement at 3 months and thereafter up to 12 months. The secondary
      endpoint includes: cumulative incidence of death and stroke within 30 days after the
      procedure; death or ipsilateral stroke between 31 days and 1 year; major stroke, ischemic
      stroke, or hemorrhagic stroke within 30 days after the procedure; major stroke, ischemic
      stroke, or hemorrhagic stroke between 31 days and 1 year; cognitive function measured by
