        (GSK) definition of highly effective: having a failure rate of less than 1 percentage (%)
        per year when used consistently and correctly and, when applicable, in accordance with the
        product label. For non-product methods (e.g., male sterility), the investigator determines
        what is consistent and correct use.

        The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use
        these methods of contraception.

        Females: A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-reproductive
        potential defined as: Pre-menopausal females with one of the following:

        Documented tubal ligation Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with follow-up
        confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion Hysterectomy Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy
        Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea in questionable cases a blood
        sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels consistent
        with menopause (refer to laboratory reference ranges for confirmatory levels). Females on
        hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required
        to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT
        during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
        post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment.

             second collection. (Note that, although not required, in Phase 1, the Investigator
             should consider enrolling participant with a large number of available PBSCs to permit
             subsequent ASCT, as participants in Stage 1 may received a dose lower than that
             determined to be effective.)

          5. Age 18-75 years.

          9. The effects of ONC201 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,
             women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform
             her treating physician immediately.

         10. Tumor specimen (paraffin-embedded block or frozen tissue) from prior resection or
             biopsy available that is sufficient to perform pharmacodynamic assays (>3 slides for
             IHC)

         11. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have received bevacizumab therapy.

          2. Patients with known brain metastases will be excluded from the phase I portion of the
             study. In the phase II portion, patients with known CNS metastases will be limited to
             20% of the patient population to accrue proportionately. Patients with CNS metastases
             must be stable after therapy for CNS metastases (such as surgery, radiotherapy or
             stereotactic radiosurgery) for > 3 month and must be off steroid treatment prior to

             eligible.

          3. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to ONC201 or its excipients.

          4. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          5. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ONC201 is novel agent with unknown
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with ONC201, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with
             ONC201.

          6. Patients with a known HIV-positive test on combination antiretroviral therapy are
             ineligible for the initial first-in-man trial because of the potential for
             pharmacokinetic interactions with ONC201. In addition, these patients are at increased
             risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate
             studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy
             when indicated.

          7. Patients with known history of cardiac arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation,
             tachyarrhythmias or bradycardia will be excluded. Patients receiving therapeutic
             agents known to prolong QT interval will be excluded. Patients with history of CHF, or
             MI or stroke in the last 3 months will be excluded. Patients with a history of
             seizures will be excluded form the initial trial because ONC201 crosses the
             blood-brain barrier and this may affect their anti-seizure therapy.

          8. Active drug use or alcoholism.

             developing fetus remains unknown and that cytarabine is a pregnancy risk category D
             drug with known teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because of the potential adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ficlatuzumab and
             cytarabine, breastfeeding should be discontinued while on study. Patients who become

             urine UPT 24 hours before initiating lenalidomide treatment.

             *FCBP: A female of childbearing potential (FCBP) is a sexually mature female who: 1)
             has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been
             naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out

             commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable
             methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one additional effective
             method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before she starts taking lenalidomide. FCBP
             must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing. Men must agree to use a latex condom
             during sexual contact with a FCBP even if they have had a successful vasectomy. See

             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because lenalidomide has
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with lenalidomide, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is
             treated with lenalidomide.

          -  Known sera-positive for or active viral infection with human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Patients who are

          -  Patients must have steroid refractory classic cutaneous, myofascial, or
             sclerodermatous cGVHD (+/- other organ involvement, clinically diagnosed), defined as
             having persistent signs and symptoms of chronic GVHD despite the use of prednisone at
             ≥ 0.25 mg/kg/day (or 0.5 mg/kg every other day) for at least 4 weeks in the preceding
             12 months (or equivalent dosing of alternate corticosteroids) without complete
             resolution of signs and symptoms or if not improving on any line of therapy beyond
             steroids or if treating physician feels that increasing or adding steroids is not in
             the patient's best interests. Note that the dose of systemic steroids can certainly be
             lower than 0.25 mg/kg/day at enrollment.

          -  Stable dose of corticosteroids for 4 weeks prior to enrollment

          -  No addition or subtraction of other immunosuppressive medications (e.g., calcineurin
             inhibitors, sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil) for 4 weeks prior to enrollment. The
             dose of immunosuppressive medicines may be adjusted based on the therapeutic range of
             that drug

          -  Serum Cr ≤ 2 gm / dL

          -  Adequate hepatic function (total bilirubin < 2.0 mg/dl, AST < 5x ULN), unless hepatic
             dysfunction is a manifestation of cGVHD. For patients in whom a diagnosis of hemolysis
             or Gilbert's is made, the total bilirubin is allowed to be elevated. For patients with
             abnormal LFTs above the thresholds, documented cGVHD on liver biopsy will be required
             prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients must have adequate bone marrow function as defined by ANC ≥ 1000 / µl and
             platelets ≥ 20,000 / µl without growth factor or transfusional support

             gastrointestinal tract or known malabsorption syndromes.

          -  Patients who have previously been treated with systemic LDE225 or with other Hh
             pathway inhibitors.

               -  Patients who have neuromuscular disorders (e.g. inflammatory myopathies, muscular
                  dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy) or are on
                  concomitant treatment with drugs that are recognized to cause rhabdomyolysis,
                  such as HMG CoA inhibitors (statins), clofibrate and gemfibrozil, and that cannot
                  be discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to starting LDE225 treatment. If it is
                  essential that the patient stays on a statin to control hyperlipidemia, only
                  pravastatin may be used with extra caution.

               -  Patients who are planning on embarking on a new strenuous exercise regimen after
                  initiation of study treatment. NB: Muscular activities, such as strenuous
                  exercise, that can result in significant increases in plasma CK levels should be
                  avoided whilst on LDE225 treatment.

          -  Patients who have taken part in an experimental drug study within 4 weeks or 5
             half-lives, whichever is longer, of initiating treatment with LDE225.

          -  Patients who are receiving other anti-neoplastic therapy (e.g. chemotherapy, targeted
             therapy or radiotherapy) concurrently or within 2 weeks of starting treatment with
             LDE225.

          -  Patients who are receiving treatment with medications known to be strong inhibitors or
             inducers of CYP3A4/5 or drugs metabolized by CYP2B6 or CYP2C9 that have a narrow
             therapeutic index, and that cannot be discontinued before starting treatment with
             LDE225. Medications that are strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors should be discontinued at
             least 7 days and strong CYP3A/5 inducers for at least 2 weeks prior to starting
             treatment with LDE225. Note that patients who require antifungal prophylaxis are
             preferred to be on fluconazole, and, patients taking voriconazole or posaconazole who
             must continue are excluded from the dose escalation phase of the study. Once the MTD
             is established, patients taking voriconazole or posaconazole will be allowed to enroll
             but at a dose adjustment to be determined before the expansion phase opens.

          -  Ongoing prednisone requirement > 1 mg/kg/day (or equivalent)

          -  Exposure to any new immunosuppressive medication in the 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

               -  Acute myocardial infarction within 3 months

               -  QTc > 450 msec for males and > 470 msec for females on the screening ECG

               -  A past medical history of clinically significant ECG abnormalities or a family
                  history of prolonged QT-interval syndrome

               -  Other clinically significant heart disease (e.g. congestive heart failure,
                  uncontrolled hypertension, history of labile hypertension, or history of poor
                  adherence with an antihypertensive regimen)

          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive hCG laboratory test (> 5 mIU/mL).

          -  Patients who are not willing to apply highly effective contraception during the study
             and through the duration as defined below after the final dose of study treatment.

               -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
                  becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the study and
                  through 6 months after the final dose of study treatment. Highly effective
                  contraception is defined as either:

               -  Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception.

               -  Sterilization: Patient has had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.

               -  Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of
                  the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). [For female study patients, the
                  vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient]

               -  Use a combination of the following (both a+b):

                    -  Placement of a non-hormonal intrauterine device (IUD) or non-hormonal
                       intrauterine system (IUS)

                    -  Barrier method of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                       suppository.

                    -  Note: Hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, implanted) are
                       not allowed to count as contraception as it cannot be ruled out that the
                       study drug decreases the effectiveness of hormonal contraception. Patients
                       are able to continue taking oral contraceptives if desired.

                    -  Note: Woman are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing
                       potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea
                       with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of
                       vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH
                       levels > 40 mIU/mL and estradiol < 20 pg/mL or have had surgical bilateral
                       oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the
                       case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman
                       has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered
                       not of child bearing potential

               -  Male patient must use highly effective (double barrier) methods of contraception
                  (e.g., spermicidal gel plus condom) for the entire duration of the study, and
                  continue using contraception and refrain from fathering a child for 6 months
                  following the study drug. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized
                  men as well as during intercourse with a male partner in order to prevent
                  delivery of the study treatment via seminal fluid

               -  Sexually active males who are unwilling to use a condom during intercourse while
                  taking the study drug and for 6 months after stopping investigational medications
                  and agree not to father a child in this period.

          -  Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.

                       the preceding 12 months or ≥10X ULN OR >500 U/L in patients with abnormal or
                       no measured ALT baseline in the preceding 12 months with detectable HCV RNA
                       excluding those with any prior positive anti-HCV. OR

                    -  Detectable HCV RNA with prior negative anti-HCV Ab or undetectable HCV RNA
                       within the preceding 6 months.

               2. Acute HCV reinfection was defined by documentation of clearance of prior
                  infection (as evidenced by positive anti-HCV Ab) either spontaneously or after
                  treatment with two negative HCV RNA a minimum of 6 months apart AND meeting one
                  of the following criteria in addition to exclusion of other causes of acute
                  hepatitis:

                    -  New (<24 weeks prior to initial A5327 entry) ALT elevation to ≥5X ULN OR
                       >250 U/L in patients with documented normal ALT in the preceding 12 months
                       or ≥10X ULN OR >500 U/L in patients with abnormal or no measured ALT
                       baseline in the preceding 12 months with detectable HCV RNA. OR

                    -  Positive HCV RNA with prior negative HCV RNA within the preceding 6 months.

          -  HCV RNA confirmed to be detectable >12 weeks after first laboratory evidence of acute
             HCV and still within the <24 week from first laboratory evidence of acute HCV
             infection window. First laboratory evidence of infection was defined as date of first
             elevated liver enzymes or date of first serologic evidence of HCV seroconversion
             and/or viremia (whichever occurs first). [NOTE: If the screening visit occurred less
             than 12 weeks from the first laboratory evidence of infection, then the participant
             was required a pre-entry study visit to confirm detectable HCV RNA at least 12 weeks
             from the first laboratory evidence of infection had passed. It was optimal for this
             pre-entry visit to occur as close as possible to 12 weeks from first laboratory
             evidence to ensure timely treatment. Potential participants who entered screening but
             who had an undetectable HCV RNA (<LLOQ TND) at the pre-entry visit (when required)
             exhibited evidence of possible spontaneous clearance and will not meet the entry
             criteria.]

        [NOTE: Providers and participants were advised that not all contraceptive choices listed
        above can prevent HIV transmission and that some may actually increase the risk of HIV
        acquisition. Study participants who were sexually active with HIV-1 negative or unknown
        HIV-1 serostatus partners were advised that they needed to consider effective strategies
        for reducing the risk of HIV transmission, as well as meeting the requirement for effective

             The following histological subtypes may be included in the cohort D:

             Well differentiated liposarcoma (WD liposarcoma) and G2 dedifferentiated
             liposarcorcoma, if less than 30% of the tumour is dedifferentiated.

             A centralised diagnosis will be made to confirm that the patient can be included in
             the study.

          4. The tumour must be located in the retroperitoneum and it must be resectable and
             without evidence of regional or distal spread after the appropriate staging process.
             This point must be confirmed by the central surgeon reviewer.

          5. The location and size of the disease in the retroperitoneum must allow for compliance
             with radiotherapy limitations in healthy tissue. This point must be confirmed by the
             site's radiation oncologist and the central radiation oncologist reviewer.

          6. Measurable disease according to CHOI criteria for cohort C and RECIST V 1.1 criteria
             for cohort D.

          7. ECOG performance status 0-1.

             neutrophils ≥1,500/mm3, platelets ≥100,000/mm3). Patients with plasma creatinine ≤1.6
             mg/dl, transaminases ≤2.5 times the ULN, total bilirubin ≤ ULN, CPK ≤2.5 times ULN,
             alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 times ULN are acceptable. If the increase in alkaline
             phosphatase is >2.5 times the ULN, the liver fraction of alkaline phosphatase and/or
             GGT should be ≤ULN.

          9. Fertile men or women must use an effective contraceptive method before starting the
             study, during the study and for 6 months following the conclusion thereof. Women of
             childbearing potential who participate in the study must undergo a pregnancy test
             before starting the study.

         10. Normal cardiac function with LVEF ≥50% by echocardiogram or MUGA.

         11. HBV and HCV serology must be performed before including the patient in the study. If
             HbsAg is positive, it is advisable to rule out a replicative phase (HbsAg*, DNA HBV+).
             If positive, the patient's inclusion in the trial is not recommended, and it is at the
             discretion of the investigator to administer preventive treatment with lamivudine. If
             a potential patient is positive to anti-HCV antibodies, the presence of the virus will
             be ruled out with a qualitative PCR, or the patient cannot be included in the study
             (if the qualitative PCR test cannot be performed on the patient, they cannot be
             included in the study).

         12. Patient may have had one previous chemotherapy line (cohort D only).

         13. The patient must have a central venous catheter for the administration of the

             contraception is defined as either:

               1. Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception

                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman had
                  been confirmed by follow- up hormone level assessment

               4. Use a combination of the following (both a + b):

                    1. Placement of a non-hormonal intrauterine device (IUD) or non- hormonal
                       intrauterine system (IUS)

                    2. Barrier method of contraception: Condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                       suppository.

                       Note: Hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, implanted) are
                       not allowed as it cannot be ruled out that the study drug decreases the
                       effectiveness of hormonal contraception.

                       Note: Women are considered post-menopausal and not child bearing potential
                       if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an
                       appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor
                       symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels >40
                       mIU/mL and estradiol <20 pg/mL or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy
                       (with or without hysterectomy) at least six week ago. In the case of
                       oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been
                       confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of
                       child bearing potential.

             with sonidegib. Medications that are strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors should be discontinued
             at least 7 days and strong CYP3A/5 inducers for at least 2 weeks prior to starting
             treatment with sonidegib

             treatment.

          -  Participants with known evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.

          -  Participants with an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

          -  Participants who have received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study
             therapy.

        Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and

          -  Participants unwilling or unable to discontinue use of prohibited therapies, including
             any cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy or biologic agent (approved or
             investigational) for the treatment of TCC are ineligible.

          -  Participants with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,
             ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Participants who have undergone a major surgical procedure or trauma within 4 weeks
             prior to Cycle 1, Day 1. All wounds must be fully healed on Cycle 1, Day 1

             protocol or interpretation of results. Individuals with a history of curatively
             treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ carcinoma of the
             cervix are allowed. Participants with a malignancy that has been treated with curative
             intent will also be allowed if the malignancy has been in remission without treatment
             for ≥ 2 years prior to Cycle 1, Day 1.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the risks with B-701 are unknown
             and pembrolizumab is a PD-1 inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with B-701 and
             pembrolizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued. Women of child-bearing potential
             must agree to use adequate birth control throughout the study duration.

          -  Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV serology-positive (or known history of HIV
             seropositive status) participants are ineligible because these underlying diseases
             will confound interpretation of important safety assessments, e.g. liver function
             tests, increased potential for reactivation or exacerbation of viral infections. Such
             individuals may be taking or require other drugs, and may be at higher risk of
             opportunistic infections and adverse effects. Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV
             serology-positive individuals were excluded from the pivotal pembrolizumab clinical
             trial in melanoma, so safety of this drug in this setting is unknown.

          -  Known active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, parasitic, or other infection
             (excluding fungal infections of nail beds) at screening or any major episode of
             infection requiring treatment with IV antibiotics or hospitalization (relating to the
             completion of the course of antibiotics) within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1

          -  Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)

          -  Participants who weigh > 110 kg will be ineligible due to study drug limitations

          8. Female subjects of childbearing potential who were sexually active with a
             non-sterilized male partner must have used at least one highly effective method of
             contraception (see table below) from the time of screening and must have agreed to
             continue using such precautions for 90 days after the final dose of investigational
             products. Non-sterilized male partners of a female subject must have used male condoms
             plus spermicide throughout this period. Cessation of birth control after this point
             should have been discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual
             activity for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period was an
             acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the
             withdrawal method were not acceptable methods of birth control.

             Female subjects should have refrained from breastfeeding throughout the period
             described above.

             Females of childbearing potential were defined as those who were not surgically
             sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete
             hysterectomy) or post-menopausal.

             Females were considered post-menopausal if they had been amenorrheic for 12 months
             without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements applied:

               -  Females <50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal
                  treatments and if they had luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone
                  levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical
                  sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).

               -  Females ≥50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal
                  treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses >1 year prior to
                  study entry, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses >1 year prior to
                  study entry, or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy,
                  bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy).

             Non-sterilized male subjects who were sexually active with a female partner of
             childbearing potential must have used male condoms plus spermicide from screening
             through 90 days after receipt of the final dose of investigational products. Male
             subjects were to refrain from sperm donation throughout this period. Female partners
             (of childbearing potential) of a male subject must have used a highly effective method
             of contraception (see table below) throughout this period. Cessation of birth control
             after this point was to be discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in
             sexual activity for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period was an
             acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the
             withdrawal method were not acceptable methods of birth control.

             A highly effective method of contraception was defined as one that resulted in a low
             failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Note
             that some contraception methods were not considered highly effective (e.g. male or
             female condom with or without spermicide; female cap, diaphragm, or sponge with or
             without spermicide; non-copper containing intrauterine device; progestogen-only oral
             hormonal contraceptive pills where inhibition of ovulation was not the primary mode of
             action [excluding Cerazette/desogestrel which was considered highly effective]; and
             triphasic combined oral contraceptive pills).

          9. Subjects who were immunosuppressed, including those with known immunodeficiency.

         10. Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that included clinical
             history, physical examination and radiographic findings, and tuberculosis testing in
             line with local practice), hepatitis B (known positive hepatitis B virus surface
             antigen result), hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (positive 1/2
             antibodies). Subjects with a past or resolved hepatitis B virus infection (defined as
             the presence of hepatitis B core antibody and absence of hepatitis B virus surface
             antigen) were eligible. Subjects positive for hepatitis C antibody were eligible only
             if polymerase chain reaction was negative for hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid.

         11. History of severe allergic reactions to any unknown allergens or components of the
             study drugs.

         12. Other serious illnesses (e.g., serious infections requiring antibiotics, bleeding
             disorders).

         13. Mental impairment that may have compromised compliance with the requirements of the
             study.

         14. Lack of availability for immunological and clinical follow-up assessment.

         15. Inability to swallow or retain oral medication, presence of active gastrointestinal
             disease or other condition that would have interfered significantly with the
             absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of ensartinib.

         16. Any condition that, in the clinical judgment of the treating physician, was likely to
             prevent the subject from complying with any aspect of the protocol or that may have
             put the subject at unacceptable risk.

         17. History of allogeneic organ transplant.

         18. Subjects must not have donated blood while on study and for at least 90 days following
             the last durvalumab treatment.

          -  Patients must be non-pregnant and non-nursing; the effects of ibrutinib on the
             developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason and because B- cell receptor
             kinase inhibitors agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are
             known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use
             two forms of contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)
             prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation

          -  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; men

             continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of
             birth control: one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE
             SAME TIME, at least 28 days before starting lenalidomide; FCBP must also agree to
             ongoing pregnancy testing; men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact
             with a FCBP, even if they have had a successful vasectomy; a FCBP is a sexually mature
             woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has
             not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had
             menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months); all patients must be
             counseled by a trained counselor every 28 days about pregnancy precautions and risks
             of fetal exposure

             For this reason and because agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this
             trial are known to be tetragenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree
             to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

             adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. Patients are
             allowed to take weak potency topical corticosteroids if patient has been on a stable
             dose for more than a month.

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to HDACI, TLR-agonist, or patients with known history of pre-existing

             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study HDACI is a class agent with the potential
             for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             HDACI, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with HDACI and
             radiation. Woman of childbearing age and men sexually active with woman of
             childbearing age must agree to an acceptable method of birth control (double barrier)
             while on study.

          -  Patients with known HIV infection are ineligible because this immunomodulatory therapy
             requires a normal and functional T cell repertoire. If this study is found to be safe,
             effective, and immunogenic, HIV positive patients may be included in future studies.

             therapy (specifically Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog [KRAS] mutations,
             anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase [ALK] gene rearrangements, and EGFR T790M
             mutations) will be ineligible for study participation; if the results of molecular
             studies are not available or known at the time of study registration and subsequently
             become available, such participants will be considered eligible and if deriving
             clinical benefit may continue receiving erlotinib at the discretion of the

             strongly encouraged to receive palliative radiotherapy prior to enrollment.

          -  Reproductive Status: Rucaparib caused post-implantation loss (100% early resorptions)
             at all doses administered in an embryo-fetal development study. Based on its mechanism
             of action, nivolumab can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.

             requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, childhood
             asthma that is not currently active, or conditions not expected to recur in the
             absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll.

          -  Patients with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (>
             10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14
             days of study drug administration except for adrenal replacement steroid doses > 10 mg
             daily prednisone equivalent in the absence of active autoimmune disease. Note:
             Treatment with a short course of steroids (< 5 days) up to 7 days prior to initiating
             study drug is permitted.

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Prior exposure to PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors, other immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g.
             anti-LAG-3, and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies), or PARP inhibitors.

          -  Patients with a ""currently active"" second invasive malignancy other than non-melanoma
             skin cancers. Patients are not considered to have a ""currently active"" malignancy if
             they have completed therapy and have been free of disease for ≥ 1 years.

          -  Patients with known and untreated or progressing brain metastases are excluded from
             this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic
             and other adverse events. Patients whose brain metastases have been treated with
             surgery and/or radiotherapy and are without evidence of progression on scan for at
             least 4 weeks, and are off steroids or antiseizure medications, will be eligible .

          -  Patients with symptomatic or impending spinal cord compression are not eligible unless
             appropriately treated.

             composition to nivolumab or rucaparib.

          -  Based on in vitro CYP interaction studies, caution should be used for concomitant
             medications with a narrow therapeutic window that are substrates of CYP2C19, CYP2C9,
             and/or CYP3A. Selection of an alternate concomitant medication is recommended. Caution
             should also be exercised for concomitant use of certain statin drugs (e.g.
             rosuvastatin and fluvastatin) due to potential increase in exposure from inhibition of
             BCRP and CYP2C9. An updated list of clinically relevant P450 drug interactions (e.g:
             Flockhart Table http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/main-table/) should be
             reviewed while screening patients for study.

               -  Patients taking warfarin should have international normalized ration (INR)
                  monitored regularly according to standard institutional practices

               -  Because rucaparib is a moderate inhibitor of P-gp in vitro, caution should be
                  exercised for patients receiving rucaparib and requiring concomitant medication
                  with digoxin. Patients taking digoxin should have their digoxin levels monitored
                  after starting rucaparib and then regularly per standard clinical practice.

          -  Patients on parenteral nutrition are not eligible. Patients must not have a
             pre-existing duodenal stent or any gastrointestinal disorder or defect that would, in
             the opinion of the treating investigator, interfere with absorption of rucaparib.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, requirement for
             oxygen therapy, ongoing or active infection other than minor urinary tract infection,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          -  Known history of chronic hepatitis B or C as evidenced by:

               -  Positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen

               -  Positive test for qualitative hepatitis C viral load (by polymerase chain
                  reaction [PCR])

               -  Note: Subjects with positive hepatitis C antibody and negative quantitative
                  hepatitis C by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are eligible.

          -  Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             rucaparib. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.

          -  Prior organ allograft or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.

          -  Adverse effect of prior therapy not improved to Common Terminology Criteria for
             Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 1 or below with the exception of alopecia or lymphopenia.
             Ongoing Grade 2 non-hematologic toxicity (e.g. neuropathy) related to most recent
             treatment regimen may be permitted with prior advanced approval from the Lead
             Principal Investigator.

          -  Initiated denosumab or bisphosphonate therapy or adjusted denosumab or bisphosphonate
             dose/regimen within 4 weeks prior to first dose of rucaparib. Patients on a stable

          -  Evidence or history of active or latent tuberculosis infection including purified
             protein derivative (PPD) recently converted to positive.

          -  Use of non-oncology vaccines containing live virus for prevention of infectious
             diseases within 12 weeks prior to study drug. The use of inactivated seasonal
             influenza vaccines, e.g., Fluzone®, will be permitted on study without restriction.

         17. Female subjects of childbearing potential who were sexually active with a
             nonsterilized male partner must have used at least one highly effective method of
             contraception from the time of screening, and must have agreed to continue using such
             precautions for 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab or for 6 months after the
             last dose of tremelimumab (whichever was longer). Non-sterilized male partners of a
             female subject must have used male condoms plus spermicide throughout this period.
             Cessation of birth control after this point should have been discussed with a
             responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the
             trial and the drug washout period was an acceptable practice; however, periodic
             abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method were not acceptable methods
             of birth control.

             Female subjects should have refrained from breastfeeding throughout the period
             described above.

             Females of childbearing potential were defined as those who were not surgically
             sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete
             hysterectomy) or postmenopausal.

             Females were considered post-menopausal if they had been amenorrheic for 12 months
             without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements applied:

               -  Females < 50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal
                  treatments and if they had luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone
                  levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical
                  sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).

               -  Females ≥ 50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal
                  treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, had
                  chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, or underwent
                  surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or
                  hysterectomy).

             Women of childbearing potential must have had a negative serum β-HCG pregnancy test
             (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) conducted during screening
             and a negative urine β-HCG pregnancy test conducted prior to study drug administration
             on Day -31. Ongoing serum pregnancy tests were conducted according to the study
             protocol.

             Nonsterilized male subjects who were sexually active with a female partner of
             childbearing potential must have used male condoms plus spermicide from screening
             through 90 days after last dose of durvalumab or through 6 months after the last dose
             of tremelimumab (whichever was longer). Female partners (of childbearing potential) of
             a male subject must have used a highly effective method of contraception throughout
             the period described above. Cessation of birth control after this point should have
             been discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual activity for the
             total duration of the trial and the drug washout period was an acceptable practice;
             however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method were not
             acceptable methods of contraception.

             Male subjects should have refrained from sperm donation throughout this period. A
             highly effective method of contraception was defined as one that resulted in a low
             failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Note
             that some contraception methods were not considered highly effective (e.g., male or
             female condom with or without spermicide; female cap, diaphragm, or sponge with or
             without spermicide; non-copper containing intrauterine device; progestogen-only oral
             hormonal contraceptive pills where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of
             action [excluding Cerazette/desogestrel which was considered highly effective]; and
             triphasic combined oral contraceptive pills).

         18. Any condition that, in the clinical judgment of the treating physician, was likely to
             prevent the subject from complying with any aspect of the protocol or that may have
             put the subject at unacceptable risk.

         19. Subjects must not have donated blood while on study and for at least 90 days following
             the last durvalumab treatment or for 6 months following the last tremelimumab
             treatment, whichever was longer.

             until 2 weeks after the last dose of study medication: a) Vasectomy with documentation
             of azoospermia. The documentation on male sterility can come from the site
             personnel's: review of subject's medical records, medical examination and/or semen

             understand how to properly use these methods of contraception.

          -  Female of non-reproductive potential (FNRP) is eligible to participate in this study
             if she meets at least one of the following conditions: a) Females with one of the

             techniques (e.g., in vitro fertilization or donor embryo transfer): bilateral tubal
             ligation or salpingectomy, hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with follow-up
             confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral Oophorectomy

             older, A practical definition accepts menopause after 1 year without menses with an
             appropriate clinical profile, e.g., age appropriate, more than 45 years, in the
             absence of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or medical suppression of the menstrual
             cycle (e.g., leuprolide treatment). In questionable cases for women less than 60 years
             of age, a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone and estradiol
             falling into the central laboratory's post-menopausal reference range is confirmatory
             (these levels need to be adjusted for specific laboratories/assays. Females fewer than
             60 years of age, who are on HRT and wish to continue, and whose menopausal status is
             in doubt, should not be enrolled in this study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT
             to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment. For most
             forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and
             the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following
             confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can enroll into the study and
             resume use of HRT.

             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or Medical
             Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Symptoms of a clinically significant illness that may, in the opinion of the
             investigator, influence the outcome of the trial in the 4 weeks before baseline visit
             and during the trial.

             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Prolonged exposure to natural or artificial sources of ultraviolet (UV) radiation
             (e.g., exposure to sunlight other than that associated with usual daily activities,
             use of tanning booth, etc.) within 2 weeks prior to the Day 1 visit or intention to
             have such exposure during the study, thought by the investigator likely to modify the
             subject's psoriasis.

          -  In the opinion of the investigator or physician performing the initial examination the
             subject should not participate in the clinical trial, e.g. due to probable
             noncompliance, inability to understand the trial and give adequately informed consent,
             or inability to complete the Psoriasis Symptom Diary.
