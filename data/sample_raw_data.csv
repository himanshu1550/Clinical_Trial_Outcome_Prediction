        bundle branch block: QTc(F) >=480msec or an ECG that is unsuitable for QT measurements (for
        example, poor defined termination of the T wave) (Note: All potentially exclusionary QT

             characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow
             limitation is usually progressive and is associated with an abnormal inflammatory

             smoking.

             smoking of >=10 pack-years. Former smokers are defined as those who have stopped
             smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1. Number of pack years = (number of
             cigarettes per day / 20) x number of years smoked (e.g. 20 cigarettes per day for 10
             years, or 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years both equal 10 pack-years). Note: pipe and

             participation, or which would affect study analyses if the diseases/condition
             exacerbated during the study.

          -  Hepatitis: Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), positive hepatitis C
             antibody test result at screening Visit 1 or within 3 months prior to first dose of
             study treatment. (subjects with positive hepatitis C antibody due to prior resolved
             disease can be enrolled only if a confirmatory negative Hepatitis C ribonucleic acid

             within 6 months prior to Visit 1. For subjects in Germany, if a chest X-ray (or CT

             test (urine or serum) proven negative within 14 days prior to registration. If test is
             positive, pregnancy testing may then include an ultrasound to rule-out pregnancy if a
             false-positive is suspected. For example, when beta-human chorionic gonadotropin is
             high and partner is vasectomized, it may be associated with tumour production of hCG,
             as seen with some cancers. Patient will be considered eligible if an ultrasound is
             negative for pregnancy.
