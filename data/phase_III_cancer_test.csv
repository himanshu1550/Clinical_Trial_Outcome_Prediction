        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written, signed consent for trial participation must be obtained from the patient
             appropriately in accordance with applicable International Conference on Harmonization
             (ICH) guidelines and local and regulatory requirements prior to the performance of any
             study specific procedure.

          2. Must have histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced pancreatic ductal
             adenocarcinoma (PDAC) that is metastatic. The definitive diagnosis of metastatic PDAC
             will be made by integrating the histopathological data within the context of the
             clinical and radiographic data. Patients with islet cell neoplasms are excluded.

          3. Must not have previously received chemotherapy or any investigational agent for the
             treatment of PDAC. A fluoropyrimidine or gemcitabine administered as a radiation
             sensitizer in the adjuvant setting is allowed for as long as last dose was
             administered > 6 months prior to randomization and no lingering toxicities are
             present.

          4. Nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine therapy is appropriate for the patient and recommended
             by the Investigator.

          5. Patient has one or more metastatic tumors evaluable by CT scan with contrast (or MRI,
             if patient is allergic to CT contrast media) per RECIST 1.1. Imaging investigations
             including CT/MRI of chest/abdomen/pelvis or other scans as necessary to document all
             sites of disease must be performed within 14 days prior to randomization. Qualifying
             scans performed as part of standard of care prior to patient signature of the study
             informed consent will be acceptable as baseline scanning as long as scanning is
             performed < 14 days prior to randomization.

          6. Must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1,
             assessed within 14 days prior to randomization. Two observers qualified to perform
             assessment of the performance status will be required to perform this assessment. If
             discrepant, the one with the most deteriorated performance status will be considered
             true.

          7. Must have life-expectancy of > 12 weeks.

          8. Must be ≥ 18 years of age. Due to increased risk of sepsis in patients >80 years old,
             candidate patients in this age group should be thoroughly evaluated prior to study
             randomization to ensure they are fit to receive chemotherapy. In addition to all of
             the inclusion/exclusion criteria listed, clinical judgment should be used regarding
             patients' susceptibility to infection (including but not limited to presence of
             ascites or diabetes mellitus increasing risk of infection). Furthermore, the expected
             stability of their performance status while receiving repeat weekly chemotherapy
             cycles should be given special attention. Patients in this age group should not be
             randomized on the study should there be any hesitation on any of these considerations.

          9. For male or female patients of child producing potential: Must agree to use
             contraception or take measures to avoid pregnancy during the study and for 180 days
             after the final dose of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine or for 30 days for female
             patients and for 90 days for male patients, after the final napabucasin dose if
             nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine were not administered.

             performed as part of standard of care prior to patient signature of informed consent
             for the study will be acceptable as baseline laboratory work as long as testing is
             performed < 14 days prior to randomization):

               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 1.5 x 10^9/L

               2. Platelet count > 100,000/mm^3 (100 x 10^9/L). Must not have required transfusion

                  x ULN, it must be non-rising for at least 7 days.

               3. Serum creatinine within normal limits or calculated clearance > 60 mL/min/1.73
                  m^2 for patients with serum creatinine levels above or below the institutional
                  normal value. If using creatinine clearance, actual body weight should be used
                  for calculating creatinine clearance (eg. Using the Cockcroft-Gault formula). For
                  patients with a Body Mass Index (BMI) > 30 kg/m^2, lean body weight should be
                  used instead.

         13. Patient not on anticoagulation has acceptable coagulation studies (obtained < 14 days
             prior to randomization; laboratory testing performed as part of standard of care prior
             to patient signature of informed consent for the study will be acceptable as baseline
             laboratory work as long as testing is performed < 14 days prior to randomization) as
             demonstrated by prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) below or
             within normal limits (+15%).

             Patients on anticoagulation must have coagulation values within the therapeutic range
             appropriate for the anti-coagulation indication.

         14. Patient has no clinically significant abnormalities on urinalysis results (obtained <
             14 days prior to randomization; laboratory testing performed as part of standard of
             care prior to patient signature of informed consent for the study will be acceptable
             as baseline laboratory work as long as testing is performed < 14 days prior to
             randomization).

         15. Patient must have adequate nutritional status with Body Mass Index (BMI) > 18 kg/m^2
             and body weight of > 40 kg with serum albumin > 3 g/dL.

         16. Baseline laboratory evaluations must be done within 14 days prior to randomization and
             some must be repeated < 72 hours prior to randomization.

         17. Patients requiring biliary stent placement must have biliary stent placed > 7 days
             prior to screening.

         18. Pain symptoms should be stable (of tolerable Grade 2 or less).

         19. Only patients with available archival tumor tissue must consent to provision of, and
             Investigator(s) must confirm access to and agree to submit a representative formalin
             fixed paraffin block of tumor tissue in order that the specific correlative marker
             assays (Correlative Studies) of this protocol may be conducted. Submission of the
             tissue does not have to occur prior to randomization. Where local center regulations
             prohibit submission of blocks of tumor tissue, two 2 mm cores of tumor from the block
             and 5-20 unstained slides of whole sections of representative tumor tissue are
             preferred. Where it is not possible to obtain two 2 mm cores of tumor from the block,
             5-20 unstained slides of representative tumor tissue are also acceptable. Where no
             previously resected or biopsied tumor tissue exists or is available, on the approval
             of the Sponsor/designated CRO, the patient may still be considered eligible for the
             study.

         20. Patient must consent to provision of a sample of blood in order that the specific
             correlative marker assays (Correlative Studies) may be conducted.

         21. Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow up. Patients registered on this
             trial must receive protocol treatment and be followed at the participating center.
             This implies there must be reasonable geographical limits placed on patients being
             considered for this trial. Investigators must ensure that the patients randomized on
             this trial will be available for complete documentation of the treatment, response
             assessment, adverse events, and follow-up.

         22. Protocol treatment is to begin within 2 calendar days of patient randomization for
             patients randomized to Arm 1. Patients randomized to Arm 2 must begin protocol
             treatment within 7 calendar days of randomization.

         23. The patient is not receiving therapy in a concurrent clinical study and the patient
             agrees not to participate in other interventional clinical studies during their
             participation in this trial while on study treatment. Patients participating in
             surveys or observational studies are eligible to participate in this study.
