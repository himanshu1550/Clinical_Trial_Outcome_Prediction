        A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following
        criteria apply:

          -  Male or female subjects with a clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease in
             accordance with the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, with symptoms of AD for at least 3 months.

          -  A Haschinski ischaemia score less than or equal to 4.

          -  Has undergone MRI or CT scan in the last 12 months. (For subjects not meeting this
             criteria, as scan will be conducted as part of the screening procedures).

          -  The subject has an MMSE score at Screening of 16 to 24 inclusive.

          -  Male or female aged 50 or above, at the time of signing the informed consent.

          -  If female, the subject must be post-menopausal, i.e. 12 months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle
             stimulating hormone (FSH) greater than 40 MlU/ml and estradiol less than 40 pg/ml
             (<140 pmol/L) is confirmatory] or surgically sterile (documented tubal ligation or
             hysterectomy). [Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal
             status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods in Section
             8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must
             discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study
             enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the
             cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage
             of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of
             HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.]

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section
             8.1. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study
             medication until 14 days after the last dose of study medication.

          -  The subject has the ability to comply with the study procedures as judged by the
             investigator.

          -  Subject lives with (or has substantial periods of contact with) a permanent caregiver
             who is willing to attend all visits, oversee the subject's compliance with
             protocol-specified procedures and study medication, and report on subject's status. A
             permanent caregiver is one who is able to provide care to the subject for the duration
             of the study without interruption for more than 1 week at a time. If at times during
             the study the permanent caregiver is unable to look after the subject, this period of
             absence of the caregiver must be covered by another caregiver. A permanent caregiver
             need not be living in the same residence with the subject. For such a caregiver, the
             investigator has to be satisfied that the subject can contact the caregiver readily
             during the times when the caregiver is not with the subject. If in doubt about whether
             a subject's care arrangements are suitable for inclusion, the investigator should
             discuss this with the GSK Medical Monitor.

          -  The subject has provided full written informed consent prior to the performance of any
             protocol specific procedure, or if unable to provide informed consent due to cognitive
             status, full written informed consent on behalf of the subject has been provided by a
             legally acceptable representative.

          -  The caregiver has provided his / her written consent prior to the performance of any
             protocol specific procedure

          -  AST and ALT less than 2xULN; alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin, less than or equal to
             1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin greater than 1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is
             fractionated and direct bilirubin less than 35%).

          -  If the subject is on any prior medications, they should satisfy the requirements in
             Section 9.

        A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria
        apply:

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, following review of CT/MRI scans in the past 12
             months and completion of neurological review there could be other probable causes of
             dementia which include, but are not limited to:

          -  History and/or evidence (CT or MRI scan performed since the onset of symptoms) of any
             other CNS disorder that could be interpreted as the primary cause of dementia: e.g.
             cerebrovascular disease, structural or developmental abnormality, epilepsy,
             infections, degenerative or inflammatory/demyelinating CNS conditions other than AD.

          -  Clinically significant focal findings on the neurological exam (excluding changes
             attributable to peripheral nervous system injury).

          -  Abnormal result of vitamin B12 and syphilis serology, where this is thought to be the
             cause of, or to contribute to the severity of, the subject's dementia. Subjects should
             be euthyroid based on laboratory results at the screening visit. Subjects maintained
             on thyroid medication must be euthyroid for a period of 2 months prior to the
             screening visit. If laboratory values are outside normal limits, but the investigator
             believes that the thyroid condition is stable and has no impact on cognition, such
             cases will be decided on case by case basis in discussion with the medical monitor.

          -  Diagnosis of possible, probable or definite vascular dementia in accordance with
             National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Association Internationale
             pour la Recherche l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN) criteria.

          -  Prior diagnosis of significant psychiatric illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar
             affective disorder with current symptoms related to the diagnoses such that in the
             opinion of the Investigator would interfere with participation in the study, or
             current depression (a score of greater than or equal to 8 on the Cornell Scale for
             Depression in Dementia), or subjects with other psychiatric features (including but
             not limited to having hallucinations) in their AD which in the opinion of the
             investigator, increase risk to safety.

          -  Subjects, who in the investigator's judgement, pose a significant suicide risk.
             Evidence of serious suicide risk may include any history of suicidal behavior in the
             last 6 months and/or any suicidal ideation of type 4 or 5 on the C-SSRS in the last 2
             months prior to screening.

          -  History or presence of significant sleep disturbance, such as severe insomnia or sleep
             disturbance associated with nocturnal wandering, nocturnal confusion / disorientation
             / agitation, which in the opinion of the investigator, may increase safety risk.

          -  History or presence of known or suspected seizures, unexplained significant loss of
             consciousness within last 6 months. Subjects who had febrile seizures in childhood may
             be included if these ceased by age 10 and they have had no other type of seizure in
             their medical history and have not been on anti-epileptic medications.

          -  History or presence of significant cardiovascular, gastro-intestinal, hepatic, or
             renal disease or other condition known to interfere with the absorption, distribution,
             metabolism, or excretion of drugs, or any other clinically relevant abnormality,
             medical or psychiatric condition, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, makes the
             subject unsuitable for inclusion in the study.

          -  History of alcohol or other substance abuse, according to the Diagnostic and
             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Substance related disorders (DSM-IV) criteria
             within 3 years prior to the onset of AD symptoms, or since the onset of AD symptoms.

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension with systolic BP greater than or equal to 160 and/or
             diastolic greater than or equal to 95 mmHg. Subjects with controlled hypertension with
             systolic BP less than 160 mmHg and diastolic less than 95 mmHg for at least 4 weeks
             are acceptable.

          -  Systolic BP less than 100 mmHg and/or diastolic less than 60 mmHg.

          -  Subjects with a QTcB and/or QTcF of greater than 450ms or greater than 480ms if they
             have bundle branch block or other ECG abnormalities which, in the opinion of the
             investigator is clinically significant in that they may increase safety risk.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  Pregnant females as determined by positive urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)
             test at screening or prior to dosing.

          -  Treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors (including Tacrine), memantine or selegiline
             within the last 3 months prior to screening. No patients with AD who are already on
             these medications at the time of screening will be recruited, as it would be unethical
             to withdraw these medications for study participation. Only AD subjects who are not
             yet on these medications, or who have withdrawn from these medications for other
             reasons previously, may be enrolled into this study.

          -  Use of the following medications within the last 30 days or 5 half-lives of these
             medications from screening (prohibited in Section 9.2):

          -  Any other treatments approved in the countries for treatment of cognitive symptoms of
             AD.

          -  Anti-psychotic drugs (typical or atypical dopaminergic antagonists or modulators).

          -  Any CNS stimulants (e.g., modafinil).

                  serum monoclonal protein value (generally, but not necessarily, >5g/L of
                  M-Protein). If the M band is <5g/L, then the serum free light chains(SFLC) must
                  be assessed and if >100mg/L will also be used to measure disease response. Where
                  applicable, urine light-chain excretion of ≥200 mg/24 hours will also be used to
                  measure disease response.

               -  For light chain disease (M band in serum <5g/L but measurable FLC in urine):
                  measurable disease is defined by either urine FLC OR the presence of serum FLC
                  (must be >100mg/L). Investigators can use either test (or both) but must use the
                  same method throughout the trial.

                  immunofixation): measurable disease is defined by soft tissue (not bone)
                  plasmacytomas as determined by clinical examination or applicable radiographs
                  (i.e. MRI, CT-Scan).

          5. Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections
             when treated with bone marrow-suppressive therapy, HIV-positive patients are excluded
             from the study. For patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy, the
             potential impact of pharmacokinetic interactions with sorafenib, temozolomide is
             unknown. Appropriate studies may be undertaken in patients with HIV and those
             receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy in the future.

             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition OSI-774 or other agents used in the study

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because OSI-774 has the potential for
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             OSI-774, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with OSI-774;
             these potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study

          -  Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, HIV-positive patients receiving
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible
             pharmacokinetic interactions with OSI-774 or other agents administered during the
             study; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination
             anti-retroviral therapy when indicated

                  perceived in the buttock, thigh, calf, leg, foot, or toes).

               -  The history of the pain suggests that the cause of the LSR is due to injury of
                  the lumbosacral nerve root(s) by degenerative disease of the vertebrae in the
                  lumbosacral spine or associated soft tissues (including the intervertebral
                  discs).

          2. In the investigator's opinion, the subject's diagnosis of LSR is supported by all of
             the following at screening:

               -  Based on the StEP instrument:

                    -  Neurological examination of lower limbs shows impaired muscle power, sensory
                       function, or deep tendon reflexes in the territory of the affected nerve
                       roots.

                    -  Pain/sensory disturbance in dermatomal/myotomal distribution is precipitated
                       or exacerbated by straight leg raising (the straight-leg-raising test should
                       be performed as specified in StEP).

                    -  The total StEP score is ≥ 4 (indicative of LSR as the cause of the pain)

        4. At screening, the subject has an average daily pain score for neuropathic pain due to
        LSR of ≥ 3 and ≤ 8 on the PI-NRS.

        subject must agree to use condoms during the 6-week treatment period with the study drug,
        during the 6-week posttreatment follow up period, and for an additional 8 weeks after the
        last study visit (Week 12, Visit 9).

                  six months before the onset of ""first-line"" therapy in the metastatic setting -
                  in this setting, adjuvant or definitive chemo-radiation will not ""count"" as one
                  of the two cytotoxic regimens; if however, the patient relapses within six months
                  from completion of adjuvant or definitive chemoradiation, then this therapy will
                  be considered the first-line cytotoxic therapy

                  resection of oligo-metastatic disease (for example brain metastasis and lung
                  primary resections) and the treating physician decides to administer chemotherapy
                  following all surgery, this will be considered ""adjuvant"" therapy and the same
                  rules as noted above will apply for initiation of first-line systemic therapy

               -  For example, a stage 1 (T1c) prostate cancer 2 years prior to a diagnosis of
                  NSCLC would not be exclusionary, however, a metastatic prostate cancer currently
                  receiving hormonal or chemotherapy would be excluded

        Note: Lapatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or
        abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in
        nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with lapatinib, breastfeeding should
        be discontinued if the mother is treated with lapatinib. Should a woman become pregnant or
        suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, the
        patient should inform the treating physician immediately.

             3A4 (CYP3A4) as listed in Appendix D, which in the opinion of the principal
             investigator, would make the administration of study drug hazardous. Note: patients
             receiving any strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors will be excluded.

          -  Patients with active hepatic or biliary disease (with exception of patients with

             compliance with study requirements.

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on antiretroviral therapy are
             excluded because most antiretrovirals are strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors.

          -  Any underlying medical condition which, in the opinion of the principal investigator,
             will make the administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the interpretation of

             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because cetuximab is an epidermal growth
             factor inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects based on
             the data suggesting that EGFR expression is important for normal organ development.
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with cetuximab, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with cetuximab.

          -  Total bilirubin =<1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

          -  AST (SGOT) & ALT (SGPT) =< 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal or =< 5 X
             institutional upper limit of normal if patient has liver metastasis

          -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL OR creatinine clearance >= 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with
             creatinine levels above institutional normal

          -  Other prior malignancy is allowed as long as the patient does not require active
             treatment for their second malignancy and there is no radiographic evidence of second
             malignancy; patients who are receiving hormonal therapy for breast or prostate cancer
             as adjuvant treatment are eligible

          -  The effects of bortezomib on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic
             dose are unknown; for this reason and because carboplatin, the other therapeutic agent
             used in this trial, is known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and
             men of reproductive potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration
             of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document;
             written informed consent must be obtained prior to any evaluations being performed
             solely for the purposes of screening for eligibility for this study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have only locally advanced disease (not metastatic) are excluded

          -  Patients who have received prior treatment with carboplatin, bortezomib, or another
             proteasome inhibitor are excluded

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events;
             however, brain imaging studies are not required to assess eligibility if the patient
             has no neurological signs or symptoms

          -  Patients with current neurotoxicity, defined as greater than CTCAE Grade 1
             neurotoxicity

          -  Patients must not be planning to receive any other concomitant anticancer treatment
             including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, biologic agents, or any other
             investigational drugs

          -  Patients must not have significant history of cardiac disease, i.e., unstable angina,
             congestive heart failure with New York Heart Association class 3 or 4, and myocardial
             infarction within the last 6 months

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because bortezomib is a proteasome
             inhibitor agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects;
             carboplatin has been shown to be embryotoxic and teratogenic in rats; because there is
             an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with bortezomib and carboplatin, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with these drugs

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with bortezomib and carboplatin; in
             addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated
