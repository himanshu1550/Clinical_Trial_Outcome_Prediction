               -  The subject perceives pain in one or both lower limbs at sites that are
                  consistent with the area innervated by the L4, L5, or S1 nerve roots, with or
                  without other sensory symptoms in the affected areas (typically, the pain may be
                  perceived in the buttock, thigh, calf, leg, foot, or toes).

               -  The history of the pain suggests that the cause of the LSR is due to injury of
                  the lumbosacral nerve root(s) by degenerative disease of the vertebrae in the
                  lumbosacral spine or associated soft tissues (including the intervertebral

          2. In the investigator's opinion, the subject's diagnosis of LSR is supported by all of
             the following at screening:

               -  Based on the StEP instrument:

                    -  Neurological examination of lower limbs shows impaired muscle power, sensory
                       function, or deep tendon reflexes in the territory of the affected nerve
                       roots.

                    -  Pain/sensory disturbance in dermatomal/myotomal distribution is precipitated
                       or exacerbated by straight leg raising (the straight-leg-raising test should
                       be performed as specified in StEP).

                    -  The total StEP score is ≥ 4 (indicative of LSR as the cause of the pain)

        Note: Lapatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or
        abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in
        nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with lapatinib, breastfeeding should
        be discontinued if the mother is treated with lapatinib. Should a woman become pregnant or
        suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, the

             compliance with study requirements.

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on antiretroviral therapy are
             excluded because most antiretrovirals are strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors.

          -  Any underlying medical condition which, in the opinion of the principal investigator,
             will make the administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the interpretation of

             obstructive pulmonary disease is a preventable and treatable disease state
             characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow
             limitation is usually progressive and is associated with an abnormal inflammatory
             response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases, primarily caused by cigarette
             smoking. Although COPD affects the lungs, it also produces significant systemic
             consequences.

          -  Smoking history: Current or former cigarette smokers with a history of cigarette
             smoking of >=10 pack-years [number of pack years = (number of cigarettes per day/20) x
             number of years smoked (e.g., 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes per
             day for 20 years)]. Previous smokers are defined as those who have stopped smoking for
             at least 6 months prior to Visit 1. Pipe and/or cigar smoking cannot be used to
             calculate pack year history.

             in remission for <5 years prior to Visit 1 (localized carcinoma of the skin that has
             been resected for cure is not exclusionary). Significant is defined as any disease
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk
             through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the
             disease/condition exacerbated during the study.

          -  Contraindications: A history of allergy or hypersensitivity to any
             anticholinergic/muscarinic receptor antagonist, beta2-agonist, corticosteroid,

             or tolerate further diarrhea.

             Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ZD6474 is an anti-angiogenic agent
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with ZD6474, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with ZD6474.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The following is a summary of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the Merimepodib
        Triple Combination (METRO) trial. There are also additional criteria, which will be
        reviewed with you by the staff at the clinical study site, to make sure you are eligible
        for the study. Some of the criteria are dependent on the results of blood tests and other
        tests that will be done at the clinical site.

        If you are not sure whether you meet these criteria, please call the clinical study site
        nearest you, and they can help you figure out if you might be eligible for the study:

          -  You must have been diagnosed with Hepatitis C.

          -  You must have been treated with pegylated interferon (brand names are Pegasys® or
             Peg-Intron®) and ribavirin (brand names Rebetol® or Copegus®), for at least 12 weeks.
             However, you cannot have received more than one course of this combination therapy.

          -  You must have been a ""non-responder"" to this treatment, meaning that the virus levels
             in your blood were always detectable. If you responded to the treatment and then the
             virus became detectable again (called a ""relapse""), you would not be eligible.

          -  You must not have used illegal drugs, or have a history of significant alcohol use,
             within the last year before you start the study.

        Pegasys® and Copegus® are not recommended for people with some illnesses. You should be in
        good health in general, with no illnesses that would prevent you from using Pegasys® and
        Copegus®. If you do not know whether you have any illness or conditions that would prevent
        you from using these medications, the study doctor or nurse will review your medical
        history with you to determine this.

        If you are a woman who can have children, you must be willing to use two effective methods
        of birth control during the study and for 6 months after the last dose of the medication.
        You will have monthly pregnancy tests during this time to make sure you do not become
        pregnant (This is recommended for anyone taking ribavirin, even when they are not in a
        clinical study.).

        If you are a male, your female partner must not be pregnant, and you both must be willing
        to use birth control during the time you are in the study, and for 6 months after the last
        dose of the medication (This is recommended for anyone taking ribavirin, even when they are
        not in a clinical study.).

             Society/European Respiratory Society [American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory
             Society, 2004] Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a preventable and treatable
             disease characterised by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow
             limitation is usually progressive and is associated with an abnormal inflammatory
             response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases, primarily caused by cigarette
             smoking. Although COPD affects the lungs, it also produces significant systemic
             consequences.

          -  Subjects must have a QTc <450 msec on baseline ECG or triplicate ECG averaged over a
             brief recording interval. For subjects with baseline bundle branch block the QTc will
             be <480msec on baseline ECG or triplicate ECG averaged over a brief recording
             interval.

          -  A subject will be eligible for randomisation at the end of the run-in period only if
             the following additional criterion applies: Subjects with no evidence of an ongoing
             acute infection or sinus symptoms Specific information regarding warnings,
