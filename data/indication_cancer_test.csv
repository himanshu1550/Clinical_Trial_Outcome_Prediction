             false-positive is suspected. For example, when beta-human chorionic gonadotropin is
             high and partner is vasectomized, it may be associated with tumour production of hCG,
             as seen with some cancers. Patient will be considered eligible if an ultrasound is

             developing fetus remains unknown and that cytarabine is a pregnancy risk category D
             drug with known teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because of the potential adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ficlatuzumab and
             cytarabine, breastfeeding should be discontinued while on study. Patients who become
             pregnant while on study will be removed from the study once the pregnancy is
             confirmed.

                  for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; there is no safety data in pregnancy;
                  because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing
                  infants secondary to treatment of the mother with copanlisib, breastfeeding
                  should be discontinued if the mother is treated with copanlisib and/or
                  fulvestrant; fulvestrant may also cause fetal harm and based on animal studies,

             avoid conception throughout the study [and for up to 12 weeks after the last dose of
             study drug] to minimize the risk of pregnancy. If the partner is pregnant or
             breastfeeding, the subject must use a condom. A condom is required to be used also by
             vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.

         15. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of
             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 12 weeks after the
             last dose of study drug to minimize the risk of pregnancy. WOCBP must have a negative
             serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours before the start of the investigational
             product. Highly effective contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception.

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening) with the appropriate
                  post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate. For female
                  subjects on the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner
                  for that subject.

               -  Combination of any two of the following (a+b or a+c or b+c):

               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other
                  forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate <
                  1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.

               -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).

             Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault
             caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.

             In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill
             for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

             Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile
             (e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks prior
             to screening. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of
             the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered
             not of child bearing potential.

             devices). At the discretion of the Investigator, acceptable methods of contraception
             may include total abstinence in cases where the lifestyle of the patient ensures
             compliance. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
             post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.)

             have shown reproductive toxicity, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree
             to use effective methods of contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth

             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she
             should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this
             protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the
             duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of study drug

             least 28 days post-treatment.

          3. Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if
             the mother is treated with trametinib . Because there is an unknown but potential risk
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             trametinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with
             trametinib.

          4. History of another malignancy. Exception: Subjects who have been disease-free for 3
             years, or subjects with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer

             neuroendocrine differentiation or small cell histology.

          5. Documented metastatic disease with at least 1 bone metastasis on bone scan and
             confirmed, if necessary, by CT scan or MRI, if results of the bone scans are
             ambiguous. Patients with or without visceral involvement / lymph nodes (documented by
             RECIST 1.1) are allowed.

          6. Patients must have documented Progressive disease (PD) either by radiographic or PSA
             criteria as defined in a) and b) below:

               1. For the Radiographic PD assessment, 2 sets of scans using the same imaging
                  modality (ie CT/MRI or bone scan) and taken at separate time points are required
                  to document radiographic disease progression during or following the patient's
                  most recent anti-neoplastic therapy, (note: the 1st bone scan can be from before
                  most recent therapy but the 2nd scan must show disease progression during or
                  after the most recent therapy).

                  For patients with bone disease, progression will be assessed following
                  recommendations by the Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG3) (Appendix I):
                  appearance of 2 or more new lesions on bone scan, confirmed, if necessary, by
                  other imaging modalities (such as CT scan or MRI), if results of the bone scans
                  are ambiguous).

                  For patients with soft tissue lesions progression will be assessed using RECIST
                  1.1 criteria, (see Appendix C). Patients may have measurable or non-measurable
                  disease according to RECIST criteria version 1.1 (see Appendix C)

               2. PSA progression as per PCWG3 (Appendix I) is defined as an increase in PSA, as
                  determined by 2 separate measurements taken at least 1 week apart and confirmed
                  by a third. If the third measurement is not greater than the second measurement,
                  then a fourth measurement must be taken and must be greater than the second
                  measurement for the patient to be eligible for the study. Furthermore, the
                  confirmatory PSA measurement (i.e. the third or, if applicable, fourth PSA
                  measurement) must be defined. If a patient has received prior anti-androgen
                  therapy (e.g. bicalutamide), PSA progression must be evident and documented after
                  discontinuation of anti-androgen therapy, (note: The 1st PSA reading taken to
                  document disease progression when the patient presents can be while the patient
                  is on Casodex or other ADT).

          7. Prior surgical castration or concurrent use of an agent for medical castration (e.g.

        (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago.

        For women with therapy-induced amenorrhea, oophorectomy or serial measurements of FSH
        and/or estradiol are needed to ensure postmenopausal status.

          -  Patient who does not apply highly effective contraception during the study and through
             the duration as defined below after the final dose of study treatment:

               1. Sexually active males (unless surgically sterilized at least 6 months prior to
                  screening) should use a condom during intercourse while taking drug and for 6

                  this period, but may be recommended to seek advice on conservation of sperm. The
                  use of spermicidal foam is also highly suggested to be used with a condom as
                  another form of protection. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized
                  men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid. Males should be
                  cautioned to not donate sperm while actively receiving treatment on study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must have histologic demonstration of metastatic or locally unresectable
             transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium. Minor components (<50% overall) of
             variants such as glandular or squamous differentiation, or evolution to more
             aggressive phenotypes, such as sarcomatoid, or small cell changes are acceptable.
             However, when these atypical histologies are dominant, other treatment approaches may
             be more appropriate, and such patients are not eligible.

          -  All patients must have measurable or evaluable disease. In general, liver and lung
             lesions should be at least 1 cm, and patients with node-only disease should have
             lesions of ≥ 1.5 cm in the largest dimension. Patients with disease confined to bone
             may be eligible if a measurable lytic defect is present. Patients with a 3-dimensional
             mass or pelvic sidewall fixation on bladder examination under anesthesia are
             considered to have measurable disease.

          -  All patients must have adequate physiologic reserves as evidenced by:

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤2.

          -  No clinical history of heart disease and a normal EKG or an ejection fraction measured

          -  Patients must not have had any previous systemic chemotherapy for bladder cancer,
             including neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment given remotely. Gemcitabine/cisplatin is
             the standard of care for metastatic urothelial cancer. Patients who have received
             treatment would be either resistant or refractory to additional doses. In addition,
             they would have residual adverse effects from treatment and would be particularly
             susceptible to further neuropathic adverse events. Any prior intravesicular therapy is
             allowed.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to starting
             therapy. Men and women of childbearing potential must be willing to consent using

          -  Other invasive malignancies diagnosed within the last 5 years, with the exceptions of
             adequately treated localized cured prostate cancer, in situ carcinoma of the cervix
             uteri and basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Cancer survivors, who have

          -  Significant acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, disease or laboratory
             abnormality which in the judgment of the Investigator would place the patient at undue
             risk or interfere with the study. Examples include, but are not limited to:

        Registration Exclusion Criteria

          -  Evidence of distant metastasis present by CT scan, bone scan, or physical exam within
             one year prior to entry into the trial.

          -  History of other malignancy ≤ 5 years previous with the exception of basal cell or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which were treated with local resection only or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to sonidegib or other agents used in the study.

          -  Planning to embark on a new strenuous exercise regimen after initiation of study
             treatment. Muscular activities, such as strenuous exercise, that can result in
             significant increases in plasma CK levels should be avoided while on sonidegib
             treatment.

          -  Diagnosis of a medical condition that would lead to lack of physical integrity of the
             upper gastrointestinal tract or known malabsorption syndrome.

          -  Taking warfarin and Coumadin derivatives because of potential interactions with
             sonidegib.

          -  Receiving treatment with medications known to be moderate or strong inhibitors or
             inducers of CYP3A4/5 or drugs metabolized by CYP2B6 or CYP2C9 that have narrow
             therapeutic indices and that cannot be discontinued before starting treatment with
             sonidegib. Medications that are strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors should be discontinued at
             least 7 days and strong CYP3A4/5 inducers at least 2 weeks prior to starting treatment
             with sonidegib.

          -  Concurrent uncontrolled medical conditions that may interfere with participation in
             the study or potentially affect the interpretation of the study data.

          -  Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant heart disease, including any one
             of the following:

               -  Angina pectoris within 3 months

               -  Acute myocardial infarction within 3 months

               -  QTcF > 450 msec for males and > 470 msec for females on the screening ECG

               -  A past medication history of clinically significant ECG abnormalities or a family
                  history of prolonged QT-interval syndrome

               -  Other clinically significant heart disease (e.g., congestive heart failure,
                  uncontrolled hypertension, history of labile hypertension, or history of poor
                  compliance with an antihypertensive regimen)

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because
             sonidegib is an Hh inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient
             effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with sonidegib, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with sonidegib.

             metastatic/recurrent disease (at least one cycle each) which have not included a PD-L1
             or FGFR inhibitor. At least one regimen should have included a platinum agent unless
             contraindicated for the subject. Prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy (without a
             PD-L1 or FGFR inhibitor) is permitted and will not be counted as first-line
             chemotherapy, as long as the subject has not progressed within 12 months of the last
             dose. However, a regimen of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy will be counted as
             first-line chemotherapy if the patient progressed within 12 months of the last dose.

             conditions should be discussed with the subject before study entry)

          -  The effects of B-701 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and
             because PD-1 inhibitors such as pembrolizumab may potentially cause fetal harm, women
             of child-bearing potential (defined as those who have not been surgically sterilized
             or have not been free from menses for > 1 year) and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she
             should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this
             protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the
             duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of study drug
             administration.

             within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medications. If the urine
             test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be
             required.

          -  Female of childbearing potential must be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or
             be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the
             study and through 4 months after the last dose of study medication.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or

             and/or complications from the interventions prior to starting therapy.

          -  Participants with a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or who are receiving systemic
             steroid therapy (>5 mg prednisone or its equivalent) or any other form of

             untreated/active CNS metastases (progressing or requiring anticonvulsants or
             corticosteroids for symptomatic control). Individuals with a history of treated CNS
             metastases are eligible, provided they meet all of the following criteria:

               -  Evaluable or measurable disease outside the CNS

               -  Radiographic demonstration of stability upon the completion of CNS directed
                  therapy and no evidence of interim progression (for at least 4 weeks prior to the
                  first dose of study drug) between the completion of CNS-directed therapy and the
                  screening radiographic procedure

               -  The screening CNS radiographic procedure is ≥ 8 weeks since completion of
                  radiotherapy and ≥ 4 weeks since the discontinuation of corticosteroids and
                  anticonvulsants Note: These exceptions do not include carcinomatous meningitis
                  which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.

             therapy (or recombinant antibody-related fusion proteins)

          -  Participants with active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment (>5
             mg of prednisone or its equivalent) in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease
             modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy
             (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for
             adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic
             treatment.

          -  Participants with known evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.

          -  Participants with an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

          -  Participants who have received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study
             therapy.

        Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
        are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated
        vaccines, and are not allowed.

          -  Participants who have had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 2 weeks
             prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 or who have not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from
             adverse events due to agents administered more than 2 weeks earlier.

          -  Participants unwilling or unable to discontinue use of prohibited therapies, including
             any cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy or biologic agent (approved or
             investigational) for the treatment of TCC are ineligible.

          -  Participants with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,
             ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Participants who have undergone a major surgical procedure or trauma within 4 weeks
             prior to Cycle 1, Day 1. All wounds must be fully healed on Cycle 1, Day 1

          -  Participants with a history of other malignancy which could affect compliance with the
             protocol or interpretation of results. Individuals with a history of curatively
             treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ carcinoma of the
             cervix are allowed. Participants with a malignancy that has been treated with curative
             intent will also be allowed if the malignancy has been in remission without treatment
             for ≥ 2 years prior to Cycle 1, Day 1.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the risks with B-701 are unknown
             and pembrolizumab is a PD-1 inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with B-701 and
             pembrolizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued. Women of child-bearing potential
             must agree to use adequate birth control throughout the study duration.

          -  Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV serology-positive (or known history of HIV
             seropositive status) participants are ineligible because these underlying diseases
             will confound interpretation of important safety assessments, e.g. liver function
             tests, increased potential for reactivation or exacerbation of viral infections. Such
             individuals may be taking or require other drugs, and may be at higher risk of
             opportunistic infections and adverse effects. Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV
             serology-positive individuals were excluded from the pivotal pembrolizumab clinical
             trial in melanoma, so safety of this drug in this setting is unknown.

          -  Known active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, parasitic, or other infection
             (excluding fungal infections of nail beds) at screening or any major episode of
             infection requiring treatment with IV antibiotics or hospitalization (relating to the
             completion of the course of antibiotics) within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1

          -  Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)

          -  Participants who weigh > 110 kg will be ineligible due to study drug limitations

             treated with therapeutic anti-coagulants for at least 6 weeks are eligible, with the
             exception of participants being treated with warfarin, which is prohibited on this
             study; other oral anti-coagulants may be allowed after discussion with overall
             principal investigator (PI), but short half-life low molecular weight heparins are

             prior to starting olaparib is 5 weeks for enzalutamide or phenobarbital and 4 weeks
             for other agents

          -  Patients requiring concomitant therapy with phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine,
             or valproic acid

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements; specifically, patients with any of the following within 6 months
             prior to starting treatment are excluded:

               -  Acute myocardial infarction

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because olaparib and cediranib are agents
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with olaparib or cediranib, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with olaparib or cediranib; these potential
             risks may also apply to other agents used in this study

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             olaparib and cediranib; in addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal
             infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be
             undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated

          -  Patients must be willing and able to check and record daily blood pressure readings if
             receiving cediranib

             pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic
             gonadotropin) or nursing.

          8. Female subjects of childbearing potential who were sexually active with a
             non-sterilized male partner must have used at least one highly effective method of
             contraception (see table below) from the time of screening and must have agreed to
             continue using such precautions for 90 days after the final dose of investigational
             products. Non-sterilized male partners of a female subject must have used male condoms
             plus spermicide throughout this period. Cessation of birth control after this point
             should have been discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual
             activity for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period was an
             acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the
             withdrawal method were not acceptable methods of birth control.

             Female subjects should have refrained from breastfeeding throughout the period
             described above.

             Females of childbearing potential were defined as those who were not surgically
             sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete
             hysterectomy) or post-menopausal.

             Females were considered post-menopausal if they had been amenorrheic for 12 months
             without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements applied:

               -  Females <50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal
                  treatments and if they had luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone
                  levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical
                  sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).

               -  Females ≥50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal
                  treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses >1 year prior to
                  study entry, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses >1 year prior to
                  study entry, or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy,
                  bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy).

             Non-sterilized male subjects who were sexually active with a female partner of
             childbearing potential must have used male condoms plus spermicide from screening
             through 90 days after receipt of the final dose of investigational products. Male
             subjects were to refrain from sperm donation throughout this period. Female partners
             (of childbearing potential) of a male subject must have used a highly effective method
             of contraception (see table below) throughout this period. Cessation of birth control
             after this point was to be discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in
             sexual activity for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period was an
             acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the
             withdrawal method were not acceptable methods of birth control.

             A highly effective method of contraception was defined as one that resulted in a low
             failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Note
             that some contraception methods were not considered highly effective (e.g. male or
             female condom with or without spermicide; female cap, diaphragm, or sponge with or
             without spermicide; non-copper containing intrauterine device; progestogen-only oral
             hormonal contraceptive pills where inhibition of ovulation was not the primary mode of
             action [excluding Cerazette/desogestrel which was considered highly effective]; and
             triphasic combined oral contraceptive pills).

          9. Subjects who were immunosuppressed, including those with known immunodeficiency.

         10. Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that included clinical
             history, physical examination and radiographic findings, and tuberculosis testing in
             line with local practice), hepatitis B (known positive hepatitis B virus surface
             antigen result), hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (positive 1/2
             antibodies). Subjects with a past or resolved hepatitis B virus infection (defined as
             the presence of hepatitis B core antibody and absence of hepatitis B virus surface
             antigen) were eligible. Subjects positive for hepatitis C antibody were eligible only
             if polymerase chain reaction was negative for hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid.

         11. History of severe allergic reactions to any unknown allergens or components of the
             study drugs.

         12. Other serious illnesses (e.g., serious infections requiring antibiotics, bleeding
             disorders).

         13. Mental impairment that may have compromised compliance with the requirements of the
             study.

         14. Lack of availability for immunological and clinical follow-up assessment.

         15. Inability to swallow or retain oral medication, presence of active gastrointestinal
             disease or other condition that would have interfered significantly with the
             absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of ensartinib.

         16. Any condition that, in the clinical judgment of the treating physician, was likely to
             prevent the subject from complying with any aspect of the protocol or that may have
             put the subject at unacceptable risk.

         17. History of allogeneic organ transplant.

         18. Subjects must not have donated blood while on study and for at least 90 days following
             the last durvalumab treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed inoperable locally
             advanced or metastatic ER+ breast cancer. To fulfill the requirement for ER+ disease,
             a breast cancer must express, by immunohistochemistry (IHC), ER in ≥10% of cells, on
             the most recent biopsy. If ER quantification is not available, a determination of ER+
             by IHC will suffice. Central confirmation of ER status is not required.

          -  Participants must have documented HER2+ disease by overexpression and/or gene
             amplification on the most recent biopsy, per current ASCO-CAP (American Society of
             Clinical Oncology - College of American Pathologists) guidelines. Central confirmation
             of HER2 status is not required.

          -  Participants must have received prior therapy with the following agents in any
             combination, and in setting (i.e., neoadjuvant, adjuvant, metastatic, etc.). These
             therapies do not need to be the most recent line of therapy.

             metastatic lesion (chest wall, skin, subcutaneous tissue, lymph nodes, skin, breast,
             bones, lung, and liver metastases). If a reasonably accessible metastatic lesion is
             not available, the patient may go on study provided that archived tissue is available.
             However, if a reasonably accessible site is available for biopsy, the patient must
             agree to biopsy. Any patients not undergoing biopsy must be approved for study
             enrollment by the Overall Principal Investigator at DFCI. Biopsies may be done with
             local anesthesia or intravenous conscious sedation, according to institutional
             guidelines. If a biopsy requires general anesthesia, then it is only allowed if
             acquisition of tissue is clinically indicated, and excess tissue may be collected for
             research purposes. Patients without sites available for biopsy must have available
             tissue [archived formalin-fixed paraffin embedded blocks (FFPB), blocks from which
             slides can be created, or fresh frozen tissue from original diagnosis or metastatic
             setting] for correlative studies. Tissue needs to be located and available at the time
             of registration See Section 9.3 for more details.

          -  Women ≥ 18 years of age. Men are not eligible.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2 (see Appendix A).

               -  Hemoglobin ≥8g/dL

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal (ULN); in case of
                  known Gilbert's syndrome, <2 x ULN is allowed

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤3X institutional ULN without liver metastases, or ≤5X
                  institutional ULN with liver metastases

             adequate performance status and meet all other eligibility criteria.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (including premenopausal women and women less than 12
             months after menopause) must have a negative β-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)
             urine pregnancy test within 4 weeks of registration.

          -  The effects of neratinib and fulvestrant on the developing human fetus are unknown.
             For this reason and because SERD agents are known to be teratogenic, women of
             child-bearing potential must agree to be abstinent, or to use a highly effective
             double barrier method of contraception (e.g, a combination of male condom with an
             intravaginal device such as the cervical cap, diaphragm, or vaginal sponge with
             spermicide) or a non-hormonal method, while enrolled in the study, until at least 28
             days after the last dose of neratinib or 1 year after the last dose of fulvestrant.
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating
             in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. If a woman is of
             childbearing potential, she must agree to use adequate contraception prior to the
             study, for the duration of study participation, and for one year after completion of
             the study drug.

             therapy, investigational agents, hormonal therapy, or other anti-cancer therapy) or
             radiotherapy within ≤14 days prior to the planned initiation of investigational
             products, or those who have not recovered to grade ≤1from adverse events due to their
             most recent therapy (excepting alopecia).

          -  Participants who have had any major surgery ≤28 days prior to the planned initiation
             of study therapy, or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to
             agents/surgery administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Participants with known brain metastases that are untreated, symptomatic, or require
             therapy to control symptoms. Participants with a history of treated central nervous
             system (CNS) metastases are eligible. Treated brain metastases are defined as those
             without ongoing requirement for corticosteroids, as ascertained by clinical
             examination and/or brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging or CT scan) completed
             during screening. Any corticosteroid use for brain metastases must have been
             discontinued without the subsequent appearance of symptoms for ≥ 7 days prior to
             registration. Treatment for brain metastases may include whole brain radiotherapy,
             radiosurgery, surgery or a combination as deemed appropriate by the treating
             physician. Radiation therapy must be completed at least 14 days prior to registration.

          -  Participant has active, uncontrolled cardiac disease, including cardiomyopathy,
             congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional classification of ≥2),
             unstable angina, myocardial infarction within 12 months of enrollment, or ventricular
             arrhythmia.

          -  Participant has a QTc interval >470 ms or known history of QTc prolongation or Torsade
             de Pointes.

          -  Participant has an active infection or unexplained fever >38.5°C (101.3°F).

          -  Participant has had another malignancy within the past 5 years with the exception of
             a) adequately treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell skin cancer, or thyroid
             cancer; b) carcinoma in situ of the breast, cervix or vulva; or c) cancer considered
             cured by surgical resection or unlikely to impact survival during the duration of the
             study, such as localized transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, or benign tumors
             of the adrenal or pancreas.

          -  Participant has significant chronic gastrointestinal disorder with diarrhea as a major
             symptom (e.g., Crohn's disease, malabsorption, or Grade ≥2 (NCI CTCAE v.4.0) diarrhea
             of any etiology at screening).

          -  Participant has known active infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus.
             Hepatitis B and C serology testing is not required, unless active infection is
             suspected.

          -  Participant is unable or unwilling to swallow tablets.

          -  Participant has evidence of significant medical illness, abnormal laboratory finding,
             or psychiatric illness/social situations that would, in the Investigator's judgment,
             limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because fulvestrant is a SERD agent with
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with neratinib and/or fulvestrant, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with neratinib and/or fulvestrant.

             birth control: one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE
             SAME TIME, at least 28 days before starting lenalidomide; FCBP must also agree to
             ongoing pregnancy testing; men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact
             with a FCBP, even if they have had a successful vasectomy; a FCBP is a sexually mature
             woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has
             not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection or an infection requiring systemic antibiotics, symptomatic congestive heart
             failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements; recent infections

             dose of study drug

          -  Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from this study; pregnant women are
             excluded in this study because ibrutinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the

             positive for hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or
             hepatitis C antibody must have a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) prior to
             enrollment; (PCR positive patients will be excluded)

          -  History of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage within 6 months prior to enrollment

          -  Any life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction that, in
             the investigator's opinion, could compromise the patient's safety, or put the study at
             undue risk

          2. Trauma patient

          3. Anemia (hemoglobin < 12 g/dL).

          4. Functional iron deficiency:

          2. Active bleeding requiring pRBCs transfusion.

          3. Iron overload (serum ferritin concentration ≥ 1,500 ng/mL). The serum ferritin
             concentration is an acute phase reactant that is increased during critical illness
             regardless of total body iron. Substantial levels of hyperferritinemia (serum ferritin
             concentration > 1,000 ng/dL) were observed in both NCT00450177 and NCT01180894 without
             increased risk of infection and despite both low TSAT and IDE. For these reasons, we
             believe that relative hyperferritinemia (serum ferritin concentration 500 - 1,500
             ng/dL) is neither harmful nor indicative of bone marrow iron availability.

          -  Persons with tumors known to have biomarkers predictive of resistance to erlotinib
             therapy (specifically Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog [KRAS] mutations,
             anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase [ALK] gene rearrangements, and EGFR T790M
             mutations) will be ineligible for study participation; if the results of molecular
             studies are not available or known at the time of study registration and subsequently
             become available, such participants will be considered eligible and if deriving
             clinical benefit may continue receiving erlotinib at the discretion of the
             investigator and study chair

             strongly encouraged to receive palliative radiotherapy prior to enrollment.

          -  Reproductive Status: Rucaparib caused post-implantation loss (100% early resorptions)
             at all doses administered in an embryo-fetal development study. Based on its mechanism
             of action, nivolumab can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.

             asthma that is not currently active, or conditions not expected to recur in the
             absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll.

          -  Patients with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (>
             10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14
             days of study drug administration except for adrenal replacement steroid doses > 10 mg
             daily prednisone equivalent in the absence of active autoimmune disease. Note:
             Treatment with a short course of steroids (< 5 days) up to 7 days prior to initiating
             study drug is permitted.

          -  Patients with a ""currently active"" second invasive malignancy other than non-melanoma
             skin cancers. Patients are not considered to have a ""currently active"" malignancy if
             they have completed therapy and have been free of disease for ≥ 1 years.

          -  Patients with known and untreated or progressing brain metastases are excluded from
             this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic
             and other adverse events. Patients whose brain metastases have been treated with
             surgery and/or radiotherapy and are without evidence of progression on scan for at
             least 4 weeks, and are off steroids or antiseizure medications, will be eligible .

             composition to nivolumab or rucaparib.

          -  Based on in vitro CYP interaction studies, caution should be used for concomitant
             medications with a narrow therapeutic window that are substrates of CYP2C19, CYP2C9,
             and/or CYP3A. Selection of an alternate concomitant medication is recommended. Caution
             should also be exercised for concomitant use of certain statin drugs (e.g.
             rosuvastatin and fluvastatin) due to potential increase in exposure from inhibition of
             BCRP and CYP2C9. An updated list of clinically relevant P450 drug interactions (e.g:
             Flockhart Table http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/main-table/) should be
             reviewed while screening patients for study.

               -  Patients taking warfarin should have international normalized ration (INR)
                  monitored regularly according to standard institutional practices

               -  Because rucaparib is a moderate inhibitor of P-gp in vitro, caution should be
                  exercised for patients receiving rucaparib and requiring concomitant medication
                  with digoxin. Patients taking digoxin should have their digoxin levels monitored
                  after starting rucaparib and then regularly per standard clinical practice.

          -  Patients on parenteral nutrition are not eligible. Patients must not have a
             pre-existing duodenal stent or any gastrointestinal disorder or defect that would, in
             the opinion of the treating investigator, interfere with absorption of rucaparib.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, requirement for
             oxygen therapy, ongoing or active infection other than minor urinary tract infection,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          -  Known history of chronic hepatitis B or C as evidenced by:

               -  Positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen

               -  Positive test for qualitative hepatitis C viral load (by polymerase chain
                  reaction [PCR])

               -  Note: Subjects with positive hepatitis C antibody and negative quantitative
                  hepatitis C by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are eligible.

          -  Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             rucaparib. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.

          -  Prior organ allograft or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.

          -  Adverse effect of prior therapy not improved to Common Terminology Criteria for
             Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 1 or below with the exception of alopecia or lymphopenia.
             Ongoing Grade 2 non-hematologic toxicity (e.g. neuropathy) related to most recent
             treatment regimen may be permitted with prior advanced approval from the Lead
             Principal Investigator.

          -  Initiated denosumab or bisphosphonate therapy or adjusted denosumab or bisphosphonate
             dose/regimen within 4 weeks prior to first dose of rucaparib. Patients on a stable

          -  Evidence or history of active or latent tuberculosis infection including purified
             protein derivative (PPD) recently converted to positive.

          -  Use of non-oncology vaccines containing live virus for prevention of infectious
             diseases within 12 weeks prior to study drug. The use of inactivated seasonal
             influenza vaccines, e.g., Fluzone®, will be permitted on study without restriction.

         17. Female subjects of childbearing potential who were sexually active with a
             nonsterilized male partner must have used at least one highly effective method of
             contraception from the time of screening, and must have agreed to continue using such
             precautions for 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab or for 6 months after the
             last dose of tremelimumab (whichever was longer). Non-sterilized male partners of a
             female subject must have used male condoms plus spermicide throughout this period.
             Cessation of birth control after this point should have been discussed with a
             responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the
             trial and the drug washout period was an acceptable practice; however, periodic
             abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method were not acceptable methods
             of birth control.

             Female subjects should have refrained from breastfeeding throughout the period
             described above.

             Females of childbearing potential were defined as those who were not surgically
             sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete
             hysterectomy) or postmenopausal.

             Females were considered post-menopausal if they had been amenorrheic for 12 months
             without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements applied:

               -  Females < 50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal
                  treatments and if they had luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone
                  levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical
                  sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).

               -  Females ≥ 50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal
                  treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, had
                  chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, or underwent
                  surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or
                  hysterectomy).

             Women of childbearing potential must have had a negative serum β-HCG pregnancy test
             (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) conducted during screening
             and a negative urine β-HCG pregnancy test conducted prior to study drug administration
             on Day -31. Ongoing serum pregnancy tests were conducted according to the study
             protocol.

             Nonsterilized male subjects who were sexually active with a female partner of
             childbearing potential must have used male condoms plus spermicide from screening
             through 90 days after last dose of durvalumab or through 6 months after the last dose
             of tremelimumab (whichever was longer). Female partners (of childbearing potential) of
             a male subject must have used a highly effective method of contraception throughout
             the period described above. Cessation of birth control after this point should have
             been discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual activity for the
             total duration of the trial and the drug washout period was an acceptable practice;
             however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method were not
             acceptable methods of contraception.

             Male subjects should have refrained from sperm donation throughout this period. A
             highly effective method of contraception was defined as one that resulted in a low
             failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Note
             that some contraception methods were not considered highly effective (e.g., male or
             female condom with or without spermicide; female cap, diaphragm, or sponge with or
             without spermicide; non-copper containing intrauterine device; progestogen-only oral
             hormonal contraceptive pills where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of
             action [excluding Cerazette/desogestrel which was considered highly effective]; and
             triphasic combined oral contraceptive pills).

         18. Any condition that, in the clinical judgment of the treating physician, was likely to
             prevent the subject from complying with any aspect of the protocol or that may have
             put the subject at unacceptable risk.

         19. Subjects must not have donated blood while on study and for at least 90 days following
             the last durvalumab treatment or for 6 months following the last tremelimumab
             treatment, whichever was longer.

             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with IPdR,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with IPdR. These
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study

             disease outside the GI tract, not simply a multifocal primary tumor. Testing performed
             by the Laboratory of Pathology, NCI, unless previously conducted by a CLIA/CAP
             external laboratory; analysis will include evaluation of 4 exons of KIT (9, 11, 13,

               -  Patients must have measurable GIST as defined by RECIST v 1.1 as at least one
                  lesion not previously irradiated, that can be accurately measured at baseline
                  greater than or equal to 10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which

                  (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and which is suitable for accurate
                  repeated measurements.

               -  Progressive disease: GIST has demonstrated progression as defined by RECIST v1.1
                  within the past 12 months. Patients whose tumors do not meet this criterion, and
                  have a diagnosis of NF1, may enroll on the NF1 Natural History study.

          -  Performance Status: ECOG less than or equal to 2 (Patients greater than or equal to 16
             years of age must have a Karnofsky performance level of greater than or equal to 70%
             (or ECOG less than or equal to 2), and children less than or equal to 16 years old

                  Cockcroft- Gault formula or analysis normal serum creatinine based on age
                  described below:

                    -  Age (years): less than or equal to 5; Maximum Serum Creatinine (mg/dL): 0.8

                    -  Age (years): 5 or less or equal to 10; Maximum Serum Creatinine (mg/dL): 1.0

                    -  Age (years): >15; Maximum Serum Creatinine (mg/dL): 1.5

          -  Prior Therapy: Patients will be eligible if tumor is metastatic, unresectable,
             progressive, or if complete tumor resection is not considered to be feasible without
             substantial risk or morbidity.

               -  Since there is no standard effective chemotherapy for patients with NF1 and GIST,
                  patients may be treated on this trial without having received prior medical
                  therapy directed at their GIST. Patients who have had prior GIST-directed surgery
                  may enroll provided they have measurable disease.

               -  Since selumetinib is not expected to cause substantial myelosuppression, there
                  will be no limit to number of prior myelosuppressive regimen for GIST or other
                  tumor manifestations associated with NF1.

               -  Patients who have received previous investigational agents or biologic therapy,
                  such as tipifarnib, pirfenidone, Peg-Intron, sorafenib, imatinib or other
                  targeted therapies are eligible for enrollment. At least 4 weeks must have
                  elapsed since receiving medical therapy directed at the PN and patients who
                  received previous GIST-directed therapy must either demonstrate progression as
                  defined by RECIST, or be unable to tolerate their previous therapy. Patients who
                  received effects of all prior therapy to less than or equal to grade 1 before
                  entering this study.

               -  Cytotoxic chemotherapy last dose must have been received at least 28 days prior
                  to enrollment, their last dose of biological therapy, immunomodulatory agents,
                  vaccines, differentiating agents, used to treat their cancer at least 7 days
                  prior to enrollment, their last dose of a monoclonal antibody at least 30 days
                  prior to enrollment, and their last dose of any investigational agent at least 30
                  days prior

        to enrollment.

          -  Growth factors that support platelet or white cell number or function must not have
             been administered within the 7 days prior to enrollment.

               -  The effects of selumetinib on the developing human fetus at the recommended
                  therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential
                  and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of
                  birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study
                  participation, and for 4 weeks after dosing with selumetinib ceases. Women of
                  child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to entry.
                  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her
                  partner is participating in this study, the patient should inform her treating
                  physician immediately. Please note that the selumetinib

        manufacturer recommends that adequate contraception for male patients should be used for 16
        weeks post-last dose due to sperm life cycle.

          -  All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed
             consent.

          -  Willingness to avoid excessive sun exposure and use adequate sunscreen protection if
             sun exposure is anticipated.

          -  Willingness to avoid the ingestion of grapefruit and Seville oranges (as well as other
             products containing these fruits, e.g. grapefruit juice or marmalade) during the
             study, as these may affect selumetinib metabolism.

          -  Although not a requirement, participants will be asked to also participate in protocol
             10-C-0086 Comprehensive Omics Analysis of Pediatric Solid Tumors and Establishment of
             a Repository for Related Biological Studies. Patients with NF1 will be asked to
             coenroll

        on the NF1 Natural History Study and 08-C-0079: Natural History Study and Longitudinal
        Assessment of Children, Adolescents, and Adults with Neurofibromatosis Type 1.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients with evidence of another malignancy or benign tumor requiring chemotherapy or
             radiation therapy are excluded; however, those patients with a plexiform neurofibroma
             requiring treatment will be eligible as selumetinib has documented activity in
             plexiform neurofibromas.

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of NF1 and GIST who do not meet other eligibility criteria
             may enroll on the NF1 Natural History Study, and will be followed on this study.
             Should they require therapy for GIST based on evidence of progression, they may then
             enroll on study.

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Prior therapy with selumetinib or another specific MEK inhibitor is not permitted.

          -  Patients who anticipate the need for surgical intervention within the first three
             cycles (3 months), as surgical intervention during the period of DLT evaluation may
             affect analysis of adherence and/or make the subject inevaluable.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  Patients with the following cardiac conditions are excluded:

               -  Uncontrolled hypertension (Adults: blood pressure [BP] of greater than or equal
                  to 150/95 despite medical support/management. Participants 18 years of age and
                  younger should have a blood pressure less than or equal to 95th percentile for
                  age, height and gender. Preexisting hypertension in adults should be controlled
                  (either with pharmacological or nonpharmacological methods) at the time of
                  enrollment.)

               -  Acute coronary syndrome within 6 months prior to starting treatment

               -  Baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than or equal to 55%

               -  Previous moderate or severe impairment of left ventricular systolic function
                  (LVEF less than 50% on echocardiography or equivalent on Multi-Gated Acquisition
                  Scan [MUGA]) even if full recovery has occurred.

               -  Severe valvular heart disease

                  tumor,

               -  Ophthalmological findings secondary to long-standing optic pathway glioma (such
                  as visual loss, optic nerve pallor or strabismus) or long-standing orbitotemporal
                  PN (such as visual loss, strabismus) will NOT be considered a significant
                  abnormality for the purposes of the study

               -  Subjects with any other significant abnormality on ophthalmic examination
                  (performed by an ophthalmologist) should be discussed with the Study Chair for
                  potential eligibility.

          -  Inability to swallow capsules, since capsules cannot be crushed or broken.

          -  Patients with refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal (GI) diseases
             (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease) or significant bowel resection that may
             significantly alter the absorption of study agent

          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or
             inducers of CYP 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4/5 and UGT 1A1 and 1A3, P-glycoprotein, or
             BCRP are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is
             important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal
             product.

          -  No supplementation with vitamin E is permitted because the selumetinib capsules
             contain vitamin E

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of selumetinib on the
             developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. Because there
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with selumetinib.

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with selumetinib. Appropriate studies
             will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when
             indicated.

          -  Ongoing radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, or biologic
             therapy directed at the tumor. Those patients with a plexiform neurofibroma requiring
             treatment will be eligible, as selumetinib has documented activity in plexiform
             neurofibromas.

          -  Patients who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with the
             safety monitoring requirements of the study.

             clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic
             and other adverse events. Subjects are eligible if CNS metastases are adequately
             treated and subjects are neurologically returned to baseline (except for residual
             signs or symptoms related to the CNS treatment) for at least 2 weeks prior to study
             entry. Subjects must be either off corticosteroids, or on a stable or decreasing dose
             of ≤10 mg daily prednisone (or equivalent) for at least 2 weeks prior to first study
             treatment.

             or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are
             permitted to enroll.

          -  Participants with a condition requiring systemic treatment with corticosteroids of >
             10 mg daily prednisone (or equivalent), or subjects requiring other immunosuppressive

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ipilimumab and nivolumab are both
             agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is
             an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with ipilimumab or nivolumab, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with ipilimumab or nivolumab. A negative serum
             pregnancy test is required prior to study entry.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have an established and confirmed diagnosis of AML by World Health
             Organization (WHO) criteria, excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).

          -  Patients must have relapsed or refractory AML, defined as:

               -  Relapsed: >= 5% bone marrow blasts by morphology, reappearance of minimal
                  residual disease (MRD) (> 0.1%) by flow cytometry, reappearance of peripheral
                  blood blasts, or development of extramedullary leukemia after one or more prior
                  lines of therapy. Consolidation regimens, including autologous and allogeneic
                  HCT, do not count as a separate prior line of therapy, (e.g., 7+3 followed by
                  cytarabine consolidation followed by allogeneic hematopoietic cell
                  transplantation (HCT) would be considered one prior line of therapy). Note, there
                  is no restriction on the prior number of relapses and prior treatment of relapsed
                  disease is allowed.

               -  Refractory: no complete response (CR) or complete response with incomplete bone
                  marrow recovery (CRi) after two courses of induction therapy (e.g. therapy with
                  the intent to induce remission). Patients 75 years or older, or patients of any
                  age with comorbidities that prevent the use of further intensive chemotherapy,
                  will be eligible if they did not experience CR or CRi after one course of
                  induction therapy.

          -  Patients must have Karnofsky >= 60%.

          -  Patients must have a white blood cell count (WBC) =< 25 x 10^9 cells/L. Hydroxyurea
             and leukapheresis are permitted to satisfy this criterion.

          -  Total bilirubin =< institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) except in patients with
             Gilbert's syndrome or post-transfusion hemolysis. Patients with Gilbert's syndrome or
             post-transfusion hemolysis may enroll if direct bilirubin =< 1.5 x ULN of the direct
             bilirubin.

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT])
             =< 3 x institutional ULN (unless resulting from liver infiltration with leukemia).

          -  Creatinine clearance >= 30 mL/min (If serum creatinine not =< institutional ULN).

          -  Hemoglobin > 8 g/dL. Patients may be transfused to achieve this value.

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients will be eligible for this trial
             if they are on effective antiretroviral regimens utilizing non-CYP-interacting agents,
             they have an undetectable viral load, they have a CD4 count > 350 cells/mm^3, and they
             have no history of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining opportunistic
             infections. If there is evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, HBV
             viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated. If there is
             history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the patient must have been treated and
             have undetectable HCV viral load.

          -  Patients must be willing to submit blood samples for the integrated biomarker.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential (i.e. who are not postmenopausal for at
             least 1 year before screening or are not surgically sterile) must have a negative
             serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to the first study drug administration and
             must agree to practice one highly effective method and one additional effective
             (barrier) method of contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the
             informed consent through 4 months after the last dose of study drug, or agree to
             practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle
             of the patient. Male patients, even if surgically sterilized, must agree to practice
             effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period through 4
             months after the last dose of study drug, or agree to practice true abstinence when
             this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic
             abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods),
             withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of
             contraception.

          -  Patients may have had prior allogeneic HCT at least 3 months prior to randomization
             but should not have evidence of active graft versus host disease or require systemic
             immune suppression.

          -  Patients must be able to understand and be willing to sign a written informed consent
             document.

          -  Patients with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) will be eligible if they have a
             legal guardian or a close family member available to assist them.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must not have had prior treatment with MLN4924 (pevonedistat), azacitidine,
             or decitabine.

          -  Patients for whom, in the opinion of the treating physician, azacitidine alone is not
             an appropriate treatment will be excluded.

          -  Patients must not have documented active central nervous system (CNS) involvement by
             leukemia. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical
             trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive
             neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other
             adverse events.

          -  Patients must not have received any other investigational or commercial agents or
             therapies administered with the intention to treat their leukemia within 14 days or
             five half-lives (whichever is shorter) of first receipt of study drug, with the
             exception of hydroxyurea used to control WBCs.

          -  All non-hematologic adverse events (AEs) of prior chemotherapy, surgery, or
             radiotherapy, except alopecia, must have resolved to National Cancer Institute (NCI)
             Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade =< 2 prior to starting
             therapy.

          -  Patients must not have a history of other malignancies, except:

               -  Any malignancy that was treated with curative intent, has no known active disease
                  present for >= 1 year before the first dose of study drug, and is felt to be at
                  low risk of recurrence by the treating physician;

               -  Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence
                  of disease;

               -  Adequately treated carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease;

               -  Low-risk prostate cancer after curative surgery.

          -  Patients must not have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of
             similar chemical or biologic composition to MLN4924 (pevonedistat), azacitidine, or
             mannitol.

          -  Clinically significant metabolic enzyme inducers are not permitted during this study,
             or within 14 days before the first dose of study drugs. As part of the
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal
             product.

          -  Patients must not have severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other
             conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, could affect their participation
             in the study.

          -  Pregnant women are ineligible because, as an Nedd8 activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor,
             MLN4924 (pevonedistat) has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with MLN4924 (pevonedistat), breastfeeding must be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with MLN4924 (pevonedistat). These potential
             risks may also apply to azacitidine.

          -  Patients must not have had major surgery within 14 days before the first dose of any
             study drug or be scheduled for surgery during the study period.

          -  Patients must not have uncontrolled coagulopathy or a bleeding disorder unless
             directly attributable to their AML (e.g., disseminated intravascular coagulation).

          -  Patients must not have known hepatic cirrhosis or severe pre-existing hepatic
             impairment.

          -  Patients must not have known cardiopulmonary disease defined as:

               -  Myocardial infarction (MI) within 6 months prior to first dose. Patients who had
                  ischemic heart disease such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS), MI, and/or
                  revascularization more than 6 months before screening and who are without cardiac
                  symptoms or those with a prior non-ST elevation MI due to demand-supply mismatch
                  (NSTEM type II) may enroll;

               -  Symptomatic cardiomyopathy;

               -  Clinically significant arrhythmia:

                    -  History of polymorphic ventricular fibrillation or torsade de pointes,

                    -  Permanent atrial fibrillation, defined as continuous atrial fibrillation
                       lasting for >= 6 months;

                    -  Persistent atrial fibrillation, defined as sustained atrial fibrillation
                       lasting > 7 days and/or requiring cardioversion in the 4 weeks before
                       screening;

                    -  Grade 3 atrial fibrillation, defined as symptomatic and incompletely
                       controlled medically, or controlled with a device (e.g., pacemaker) or by
                       ablation;

                    -  Patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or < grade 3 atrial
                       fibrillation for period of at least 6 months are permitted to enroll
                       provided that their heart rate is controlled on a stable regimen;

               -  Moderate or severe pulmonary hypertension.

          -  Patients must not have uncontrolled high blood pressure that cannot be controlled by
             standard therapies.

          -  Patients must not have any life-threatening illness unrelated to cancer.

          -  Patients must not have an active, uncontrolled infection or severe infectious disease,
             (e.g. severe pneumonia, meningitis, or septicemia). Patients with an uncontrolled
             infection must not be enrolled until they have received treatment and the infection is
             under control.

          -  Patients must not have prolonged rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval >= 480 msec,
             calculated according to institutional guidelines.

          -  Patients must not have left ventricular ejection fraction < 40% as assessed by a
             transthoracic echocardiogram or radionuclide angiography within one month prior to
             study entry.

          -  Patients must not have known moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
             interstitial lung disease, or pulmonary fibrosis.

          -  Female patients who intend to donate eggs (ova) during the course of this study or
             within 4 months of receiving their last dose of study drugs are ineligible.

          -  Male patients who intend to donate sperm during the course of this study or within 4
             months of receiving their last dose of study drugs are ineligible.

                  contraception (eg, spermicidal gel plus condom) for the entire duration of the
                  study, and continuing using contraception and refrain from fathering a child for
                  6 months following the study drug; a condom is required to be used also by
                  vasectomized men as well as during intercourse with a male partner in order to
                  prevent delivery of the study treatment via seminal fluid; female partner of male
                  study subject should use highly effective contraception during dosing of any
                  study agent and for 16 weeks after final dose of study therapy
