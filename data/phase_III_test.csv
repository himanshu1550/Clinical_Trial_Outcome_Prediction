          -  COPD Diagnosis: An established clinical history of COPD in accordance with the
             definition by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society.

          -  Smoking History: Current or former cigarette smokers with a history of cigarette
             smoking of >=10 pack-years at Screening (Visit 1) [number of pack years = (number of
             cigarettes per day divided by 20) x number of years smoked (e.g., 20 cigarettes per
             day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years)]. Previous smokers are
             defined as those who have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Screening
             (Visit 1). Note: Pipe and/or cigar use cannot be used to calculate pack-year history.

          -  Severity of COPD symptoms: A score of >=10 on the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) at
             Screening (Visit1).

          -  Severity of COPD Disease: A post-albuterol/salbutamol FEV1/FVC ratio of <0.70 at

             history of >=1 severe COPD exacerbation (hospitalised) in the 12 months prior to
             Screening (Visit 1). Notes: Percent predicted will be calculated using the European
             Respiratory Society Global Lung Function Initiative reference equations; A documented
             history of a COPD exacerbation (e.g., medical record verification) is a medical record
             of worsening COPD symptoms that required systemic/oral corticosteroids and/or
             antibiotics (for a moderate exacerbation) or hospitalisation (for a severe
             exacerbation). Prior use of antibiotics alone does not qualify as an exacerbation
             history unless the use was associated with treatment of worsening symptoms of COPD,
             such as increased dyspnoea, sputum volume, or sputum purulence (colour). Subject
             verbal reports are not acceptable.

          -  French subjects: In France, a subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study
             only if either affiliated to or a beneficiary of a social security category.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             during the study.

          -  Asthma: Subjects with a current diagnosis of asthma. (Subjects with a prior history of
             asthma are eligible if they have a current diagnosis of COPD, which is the primary
             cause of their respiratory symptoms).

          -  Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency: Subjects with alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency as the
             underlying cause of COPD.

          -  Other respiratory disorders: Subjects with active tuberculosis are excluded. Subjects
             with other respiratory disorders (e.g. clinically significant: bronchiectasis,
             sarcoidosis, lung fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung diseases) are
             excluded if these conditions are the primary cause of their respiratory symptoms.

          -  Lung resection: Subjects with lung volume reduction surgery (including procedures such
             as endobronchial valves) within the 12 months prior to Screening (Visit 1).

          -  Risk Factors for Pneumonia: immune suppression (e.g. advanced human immune deficiency
             virus (HIV) with high viral load and low cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count,
             Lupus on immunosuppressants that would increase risk of pneumonia) or other risk
             factors for pneumonia (e.g. neurological disorders affecting control of the upper
             airway, such as Parkinson's Disease, Myasthenia Gravis). Notes: Subjects at a high
             risk for pneumonia (e.g. very low body mass index (BMI), severely malnourished or very
             low FEV1) will only be included at the discretion of the investigator.

          -  Pneumonia and/or moderate or severe COPD exacerbation that has not resolved at least
             14 days prior to Screening (Visit 1) and at least 30 days following the last dose of

          -  Other Respiratory tract infections that have not resolved at least 7 days prior to
             Screening (Visit 1).

          -  Abnormal Chest x-ray: Chest x-ray reveals evidence of pneumonia or a clinically
             significant abnormality not believed to be due to the presence of COPD, or another
             condition that would hinder the ability to detect an infiltrate on chest x-ray (e.g.
             significant cardiomegaly, pleural effusion or scarring). All subjects will have a
             chest x-ray at Screening (Visit 1) [or historical radiograph or computerised
             tomography (CT) scan obtained within 3 months prior to Screening (Visit 1). Notes:
             Subjects who have experienced pneumonia and/or moderate or severe COPD exacerbation
             within 3 months of Screening (Visit 1) must provide a post pneumonia/exacerbation
             chest x-ray or have a chest x-ray conducted at Screening (Visit 1); For sites in
             Germany: If a chest x-ray (or CT scan) within 3 months prior to Screening (Visit 1) is
             not available, approval to conduct a diagnostic chest x-ray will need to be obtained
             from the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BFS).

          -  Other diseases/abnormalities: Subjects with historical or current evidence of
             clinically significant cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric, renal, hepatic,
             immunological, gastrointestinal, urogenital, nervous system, musculoskeletal, skin,
             sensory, endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or
             hematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled. Significant is defined as any
             disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject
             at risk through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis
             if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study.

          -  Unstable liver disease: ALT >2 times upper limit of normal (ULN); and bilirubin >1.5
             times ULN (isolated bilirubin >1.5 times ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is
             fractionated and direct bilirubin <35 percent). Current active liver or biliary
             disease (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones or
             otherwise stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment). Notes: Stable
             chronic liver disease should generally be defined by the absence of ascites,
             encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminaemia, oesophageal or gastric varices, or
             persistent jaundice, or cirrhosis; Chronic stable hepatitis B and C (e.g., presence of
             hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or positive hepatitis C antibody test result at
             screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment) are acceptable if
             subject otherwise meets entry criteria.

          -  Unstable or life threatening cardiac disease: subjects with any of the following at
             Screening (Visit 1) would be excluded: Myocardial infarction or unstable angina in the
             last 6 months; Unstable or life threatening cardiac arrhythmia requiring intervention
             in the last 3 months; New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class 4 Heart failure.

          -  Abnormal and clinically significant 12-Lead ECG finding: Investigators will be
             provided with ECG reviews conducted by a centralized independent cardiologist to
             assist in evaluation of subject eligibility. The investigator will determine the
             clinical significance of each abnormal ECG finding in relation to the subject's
             medical history and exclude subjects who would be at undue risk by participating in
             the trial. An abnormal and clinically significant finding that would preclude a
             subject from entering the trial is defined as a 12-lead tracing that is interpreted
             as, but not limited to, any of the following: atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid
             ventricular rate >120 beats per minute (BPM); sustained or nonsustained ventricular
             tachycardia (VT); Second degree heart block Mobitz type II and third degree heart
             block (unless pacemaker or defibrillator had been inserted).

             anticholinergic/muscarinic receptor antagonist, beta2-agonist, lactose/milk protein or
             magnesium stearate or a medical condition such as narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic
             hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction that, in the opinion of the investigator
             contraindicates study participation.

          -  Cancer: Subjects with carcinoma that has not been in complete remission for at least 3
             years. Subjects who have had carcinoma in situ of the cervix, squamous cell carcinoma
             and basal cell carcinoma of the skin would not be excluded based on the 3 year waiting
             period if the subject has been considered cured by treatment.

          -  Oxygen therapy: Use of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) described as resting oxygen
             therapy >3 Liters per minute (Oxygen use <= 3 Liters/minute flow is not exclusionary.)

          -  Medication prior to spirometry: Subjects who are medically unable to withhold their
             albuterol/salbutamol for the 4-hour period required prior to spirometry testing at
             each study visit.

          -  Drug/alcohol abuse: Subjects with a known or suspected history of alcohol or drug
             abuse within the last 2 years.

          -  Non-compliance: Subjects at risk of non-compliance, or unable to comply with the study
             procedures. Any infirmity, disability, or geographic location that would limit
             compliance for scheduled visits.

          -  Questionable validity of consent: Subjects with a history of psychiatric disease,
             intellectual deficiency, poor motivation or other conditions that will limit the
             validity of informed consent to participate in the study.

          -  Affiliation with investigator site: Study investigators, sub-investigators, and study
             coordinators, employees of a participating investigator or study site, or immediate
             family members of the aforementioned that is involved with this study.

          -  Inability to read: In the opinion of the investigator, any subject who is unable to
             read and/or would not be able to complete study related materials.

          -  Medication prior to Screening: Use of the following medications within 30 days prior
             to Screening (Visit 1) or requirement for their use during the study: Use of long term
             continuous antibiotic therapy; systemic, oral, parenteral corticosteroids
             (Intra-spinal and intra-articular injections are allowed); use of any other
             investigational drug: within 30 days or 5 half lives whichever is longer.

             have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method; a woman is considered to be of
             ""reproductive potential"" if she has had menses at any time in the preceding 12
             consecutive months; in addition to routine contraceptive methods, ""effective
             contraception"" also includes heterosexual celibacy and surgery intended to prevent
             pregnancy (or with a side-effect of pregnancy prevention) defined as a hysterectomy,
             bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal ligation; however, if at any point a
             previously celibate patient chooses to become heterosexually active during the time
             period for use of contraceptive measures outlined in the protocol, he/she is
             responsible for beginning contraceptive measures

          -  COPD History: An established clinical history of COPD in accordance with the
             definition by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society as follows:
             COPD is a preventable and treatable disease state characterized by airflow limitation
             that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually progressive and is
             associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or
             gases, primarily caused by cigarette smoking. Although COPD affects the lungs, it also
             produces significant systemic consequences.

          -  Tobacco Use and Smoking History: Current or former cigarette smokers with a history of
             cigarette smoking of >= 10 pack-years [Number of pack years = (number of cigarettes
             per day /20) x number of years smoked (e.g. 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years, or 10
             cigarettes per day for 20 years both equal 10 pack years)]. Former smokers are defined
             as those who have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1. Note: Pipe
             and/or cigar use cannot be used to calculate pack-year history. COPD patients who only
             use a pipe and/or cigar are not eligible.

          -  Severity of Disease: A pre and post-salbutamol/albuterol FEV1/FVC ratio of <0.70 and a
             pre and post-salbutamol/albuterol FEV1 of <=70% of predicted normal values calculated

          -  Other Respiratory Disorders: Known alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, active lung
             infections (such as tuberculosis) and lung cancer are absolute exclusionary
             conditions. A subject, who in the opinion of the investigator has any other
             significant respiratory conditions in addition to COPD should be excluded. Examples
             may include clinically significant bronchiectasis, pulmonary hypertension, sarcoidosis
             or interstitial lung disease.

          -  Other Diseases/Abnormalities: Subjects with historical or current evidence of
             clinically significant cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric, renal, hepatic,
             immunological, endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or
             haematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled and/or a previous history of cancer
             in remission for <5 years prior to Visit 1 (localized carcinoma of the skin that has
             been resected for cure is not exclusionary). Significant is defined as any disease
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk
             through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the
             disease/condition exacerbated during the study.

          -  Chest X-Ray: A chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan that reveals evidence of
             clinically significant abnormalities not believed to be due to the presence of COPD. A
             chest X-ray must be taken at Visit 1 if a chest X-ray or CT scan is not available
             within 6 months prior to Visit 1.

             will be provided with ECG reviews conducted by a centralized independent cardiologist
             to assist in evaluation of subject eligibility. Specific ECG findings that precluded
             subject eligibility are as listed. An ECG finding that would preclude a subject from
             entering the trial is defined as a 12-lead tracing that is interpreted as, but not
             limited to, any of the following: Sinus tachycardia ≥120 bpm*Note: sinus tachycardia
             ≥120bpm should be confirmed by two additional readings at least 5 minutes apart. Sinus
             bradycardia <45bpm*Note: Sinus bradycardia <45bpm should be confirmed by two
             additional readings at least 5 minutes apart.Multifocal atrial
             tachycardia.Supraventricular tachycardia (>100bpm).Atrial fibrillation with rapid
             ventricular response (rate >120bpm). Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response

             termination of the T wave). For subjects with QRS duration>120: QTc(F) ≥480msec or an
             ECG that is unsuitable for QT measurements (e.g., poor defined termination of the T
             wave). Myocardial infarction (acute or recent) * Note: Evidence of an old (resolved)
             myocardial infarction is not exclusionary. The study investigator will determine the
             medical significance of any ECG abnormalities not listed above.

             For this definition, ""documented"" refers to the outcome of the
             investigator's/designee's medical examination of the subject or review of the
             subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview
             with the subject or from the subject's medical records.; Double barrier method: condom
             and an occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with a vaginal spermicidal

          -  COPD Diagnosis: An established clinical history of COPD in accordance with the
             definition by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society.

          -  Smoking History: Current or former cigarette smokers with a history of cigarette
             smoking of >10 pack-years at Screening (Visit 1) [number of pack years = (number of
             cigarettes per day / 20) x number of years smoked (e.g., 20 cigarettes per day for 10
             years, or 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years)]. Previous smokers are defined as those
             who have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1. Note: Pipe and/or
             cigar use cannot be used to calculate pack-year history.

             Screening (Visit 1).

          -  Severity of Disease: Subjects must demonstrate at Screening: <a post-bronchodilator
             FEV1 <50% predicted normal OR a post-bronchodilator FEV1 <80% predicted normal and a
             documented history of >=2 moderate exacerbations or one severe (hospitalized)
             exacerbation in the previous 12 months. Subjects must also have a measured post
             albuterol/salbutamol FEV1/FVC ratio of <0.70 at screening. Note: Percent predicted
             will be calculated using the European Respiratory Society Global Lung Function
             Initiative reference equations. Note: A documented history of a COPD exacerbation
             (e.g., medical record verification) is a medical record of worsening COPD symptoms
             that required systemic/oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics (for a moderate
             exacerbation) or hospitalization (for a severe exacerbation). Prior use of antibiotics
             alone does not qualify as an exacerbation history unless the use was associated with
             treatment of worsening symptoms of COPD, such as increased dyspnoea, sputum volume, or
             sputum purulence (colour). Subject verbal reports are not acceptable.

          -  Existing COPD maintenance treatment: Subject must be receiving daily maintenance
             treatment for their COPD for at least 3 months prior to Screening. Note: Subjects

             during the study.

          -  Asthma: Subjects with a current diagnosis of asthma. (Subjects with a prior history of
             asthma are eligible if they have a current diagnosis of COPD). Alpha1-antitrypsin
             deficiency: Subjects with alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency as the underlying cause of
             COPD.

          -  Other respiratory disorders: Subjects with active tuberculosis, lung cancer,

             interstitial lung diseases or other active pulmonary diseases.

          -  Lung resection: Subjects with lung volume reduction surgery within the 12 months prior
             to Screening.

          -  Risk Factors for Pneumonia: immune suppression (e.g. Human immunodeficiency virus
             [HIV], Lupus) or other risk factors for pneumonia (e.g. neurological disorders
             affecting control of the upper airway, such as Parkinson's Disease, Myasthenia
             Gravis). Subjects at potentially high risk (e.g. very low Body mass index [BMI],

             the investigator.

          -  Pneumonia and/or moderate or severe COPD exacerbation that has not resolved at least
             14 days prior to Screening and at least 30 days following the last dose of
             oral/systemic corticosteroids (if applicable). In addition, any subject that
             experiences pneumonia and/or moderate or severe COPD exacerbation during the run-in
             period will be excluded.

          -  Respiratory tract infection that has not resolved at least 7 days prior to Screening.

          -  Abnormal Chest X-ray (CXR): Chest X-ray (posteroanterior and lateral) reveals evidence
             of pneumonia or a clinically significant abnormality not believed to be due to the
             presence of COPD, or another condition that would hinder the ability to detect an
             infiltrate on CXR (e.g. significant cardiomegaly, pleural effusion or scarring). All
             subjects will have a CXR at Screening Visit 1) (or historical radiograph or Computed
             Tomography [CT] scan obtained within 3 months prior to screening) that will be
             over-read by a central vendor. Note: Subjects who have experienced pneumonia and/or
             moderate or severe COPD exacerbation within 3 months of screening must provide a post
             pneumonia/exacerbation CXR to be over-read by the central vendor or have a CXR
             conducted at Screening. For sites in Germany: If a chest x-ray (or CT scan) within 3
             months prior to Screening (Visit 1) is not available, approval to conduct a diagnostic
             CXR will need to be obtained from the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS).

          -  Other diseases/abnormalities: Subjects with historical or current evidence of
             clinically significant cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric, renal, hepatic,
             immunological, gastrointestinal, urogenital, nervous system, musculoskeletal, skin,
             sensory, endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or
             haematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled. Significant is defined as any
             disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would put the safety of the subject
             at risk through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis
             if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study. For subjects taking part in the
             physical activity monitor subset: Orthopaedic, neurological or other complaints that
             significantly impair normal biomechanical movement patterns and limit the ability to
             walk/cycle, as judged by the Investigator.

          -  Unstable liver disease as defined by the presence of ascites, encephalopathy,
             coagulopathy, hypoalbuminaemia, esophageal or gastric varices or persistent jaundice,
             cirrhosis, known biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or
             asymptomatic gallstones). Note: Chronic stable hepatitis B and C are acceptable if the
             subject otherwise meets entry criteria.

          -  Unstable or life threatening cardiac disease: subjects with any of the following at
             Screening (Visit 1) would be excluded: Myocardial infarction or unstable angina in the
             last 6 months; Unstable or life threatening cardiac arrhythmia requiring intervention
             in the last 3 months; New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV Heart failure

          -  Abnormal and clinically significant 12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) finding:
             Investigators will be provided with ECG reviews conducted by a centralized independent
             cardiologist to assist in evaluation of subject eligibility. The Principal
             Investigator (PI) will determine the clinical significance of each abnormal ECG
             finding in relation to the subject's medical history and exclude subjects who would be
             at undue risk by participating in the trial. An abnormal and clinically significant
             finding that would preclude a subject from entering the trial is defined as a 12-lead
             tracing that is interpreted as, but not limited to, any of the following: Atrial
             fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate >120 Beats Per Minute (BPM); sustained
             or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT); Second degree heart block Mobitz type
             II and third degree heart block (unless pacemaker or defibrillator had been inserted);
             QT interval corrected for heart rate by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) >=500 milliseconds

             hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             contraindicates study participation.

          -  Cancer: Subjects with carcinoma that has not been in complete remission for at least 5
             years. Subjects who have had carcinoma in situ of the cervix, squamous cell carcinoma
             and basal cell carcinoma of the skin would not be excluded based on the 5 year waiting
             period if the subject has been considered cured by treatment.

          -  Oxygen therapy: Use of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) described as resting oxygen
             therapy >3litres/minute (L/min) (Oxygen use <=3L/min flow is not exclusionary.)

             plan to enter the acute phase of a Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program during the study.
             Subjects who are in the maintenance phase of a Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program are
             not excluded.

          -  Drug/alcohol abuse: Subjects with a known or suspected history of alcohol or drug
             abuse within the last 2 years.

          -  Non-compliance: Subjects at risk of non-compliance, or unable to comply with the study
             procedures. Any infirmity, disability, or geographic location that would limit
             compliance for scheduled visits.

          -  Questionable validity of consent: Subjects with a history of psychiatric disease,
             intellectual deficiency, poor motivation or other conditions that will limit the
             validity of informed consent to participate in the study.

          -  Affiliation with investigator site: study investigators, sub-investigators, study
             coordinators, employees of a participating investigator or study site, or immediate
             family members of the aforementioned that is involved with this study.

             ascites or diabetes mellitus increasing risk of infection). Furthermore, the expected
             stability of their performance status while receiving repeat weekly chemotherapy
             cycles should be given special attention. Patients in this age group should not be
             randomized on the study should there be any hesitation on any of these considerations.

                  m^2 for patients with serum creatinine levels above or below the institutional
                  normal value. If using creatinine clearance, actual body weight should be used
                  for calculating creatinine clearance (eg. Using the Cockcroft-Gault formula). For
                  patients with a Body Mass Index (BMI) > 30 kg/m^2, lean body weight should be

             and 5-20 unstained slides of whole sections of representative tumor tissue are
             preferred. Where it is not possible to obtain two 2 mm cores of tumor from the block,
             5-20 unstained slides of representative tumor tissue are also acceptable. Where no
             previously resected or biopsied tumor tissue exists or is available, on the approval
             of the Sponsor/designated CRO, the patient may still be considered eligible for the
             study.

         20. Patient must consent to provision of a sample of blood in order that the specific
             correlative marker assays (Correlative Studies) may be conducted.

             treatment within 7 calendar days of randomization.

         23. The patient is not receiving therapy in a concurrent clinical study and the patient
             agrees not to participate in other interventional clinical studies during their

             European Respiratory Society (ERS) Global Lung Function Initiative.

          -  Reversibility of Disease: airway reversibility defined as >=12% and >=200 milliliter
             (mL) increase in FEV1 between 20 and 60 minutes following 4 inhalations of

          -  If the subject does not meet the above reversibility criteria at Visit 1 then the
             reversibility assessment may be repeated once within 7 days of Visit 1 if either
             criteria a) or b) are met: a) >=9% increase in FEV1 between 20 and 60 minutes

        A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a
        negative serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) test), not lactating, is not planning on
        becoming pregnant during the study and at least one of the following conditions applies:
        Non-reproductive potential defined as pre-menopausal females with documented tubal ligation
        or documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with follow-up confirmation of
        bilateral tubal occlusion or hysterectomy or documented bilateral oophorectomy;
        Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical
        profile (e.g., age appropriate, >45 years, in the absence of hormone replacement therapy).
        In questionable cases for women <60 years of age, a blood sample with simultaneous follicle
        stimulating hormone and estradiol falling into the central laboratory's postmenopausal
        reference range is confirmatory. Females under 60 years of age, who are on hormone
        replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt, are required to use a
        highly effective method to avoid pregnancy if they wish to continue their HRT during the
        study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status
        prior to study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks will elapse between
        the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage
        of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, subjects can resume use of
        HRT during the study without use of a highly effective method to avoid pregnancy;

          -  Antimuscarinic effects: Subjects with a medical condition such as narrow-angle
             glaucoma, urinary retention, prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction should
             only be included if in the opinion of the Investigator the benefit outweighs the risk
             and that the condition would not contraindicate study participation.

          -  Cancer: Subjects with carcinoma that has not been in complete remission for at least 5

        Criteria for Randomization:

        Patients were randomized into the study if they met all of the following criteria:

          1. The patient continued to be in general good health, meeting the entry criteria.

          2. The patient continued to have a predose/pre-albuterol FEV1 at the randomization visit
             (RV) that was ≥40% of predicted normal.

          3. The patient had no clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results or ECG
             findings at the screening visit.

          4. The patient had no significant changes in asthma medications during run-in, excluding
             the albuterol/salbutamol HFA (90 mcg ex actuator) or equivalent used as rescue
             medication as supplied per protocol.

          5. The patient did not have a upper respiratory tract infection (URI) or lower
             respiratory tract infection (LRI) during the run in period. Patients who developed a
             URI or LRI during the run in period could be discontinued from the study and allowed
             to re-screen 2 weeks after resolution of symptoms.

          6. The patient had no asthma exacerbation during the run in period, defined as any
             worsening of asthma requiring any significant treatment other than rescue
             albuterol/salbutamol HFA (90 mcg ex actuator) or equivalent or the patient's run-in
             MDPI. This included requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids and/or emergency
             department (ED) visit or hospitalization or an increase in the patient's regularly
             prescribed nonsteroidal maintenance treatment. Urgent care/ED visits where the
             treatment was limited to a single dose of nebulized albuterol/salbutamol did not meet
             the criteria of an asthma exacerbation.

          7. The patient had no clinical visual evidence (on oropharyngeal examination) of
             oropharyngeal candidiasis.

          8. The patient did not experience an adverse event that would result in failure to
             continue to meet selection criteria.

          9. The patient did not use any of the prohibited concomitant medications during the run
             in period.

         10. The patient complied with completion of the daily diary, defined as follows:

               -  completion of AM and PM asthma symptom scores on 4 or more of the 7 days
                  immediately preceding the RV.

               -  completion of rescue medication use (whether used or not) on 4 or more of the 7
                  days immediately preceding the RV.

               -  completion of AM peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements on 4 or more of the 7
                  days immediately preceding the RV.

               -  recording of AM and PM asthma inhalation therapy use on 4 or more of the 7 days
                  immediately preceding the RV.

        Eligibility is assessed 4 hours after sheath removal and within 5 days after successful PCI
        with stent placement. If a staged PCI is planned, eligibility is assessed after completion
        of the last stage.

        Successful PCI definition:

        The success of a PCI procedure is defined by 2 interrelated components: angiographic
        findings, procedural / clinical outcomes as detailed below:

        Angiographic Success A minimum stenosis diameter of < 20% (as visually assessed by
        angiography - residual blockage or stenosis reduced to less than 20% of the artery's
        diameter).

        Sufficient enlargement of the lumen at the target site to improve coronary artery blood
        flow with final thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade 3 (visually
        assessed by angiography), without occlusion of a significant side branch, flow-limiting
        dissection, distal embolization, or angiographic thrombus.

        Procedural Success No major in-hospital clinical complications(e.g. ongoing International
        Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis [ISTH] major or clinical relevant non-major
        procedural bleeding at the time of randomization, stroke, emergency coronary artery bypass
        graft [CABG]).

        In summary, a clinically successful PCI requires both anatomic and procedural success along
        with relief of signs and/or symptoms of myocardial ischemia at the time of randomization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Bleeding risks or systemic conditions

          -  Known bleeding diathesis, including but not limited to,

                  Lesion or condition, if considered to be a significant risk for major bleeding.
                  This may include but is not limited to: unresolved gastrointestinal ulceration,
                  presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding (e.g. malignancies with
                  metastasis), recent unresolved brain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or

                       test.

             Note: ESL may interfere with the action of hormonal contraceptive and therefore
             hormonal contraceptives are not sufficient for this protocol.

          9. Males must be willing to remain sexually abstinent (consistent with lifestyle) or use
             an effective method of birth control (eg, male using condom and female using

             degree of understanding of the local language at a level sufficient to complete study
             related assessments or communicate suitably with the Investigator and study
             coordinator. For subjects who do not meet this criterion, a caregiver must be able to
