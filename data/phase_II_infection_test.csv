        definition of highly effective: having a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used
        consistently and correctly and, when applicable, in accordance with the product label. For

        and correct use. The GSK definition is based on the definition provided by the
        International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH). The investigator is responsible for
        ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception;

        follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] and estradiol levels consistent with menopause). Females
        on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be
        required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue
        their HRT during the study.

        Reproductive potential agrees to follow one of the options listed below in the GSK Modified
        List of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of Reproductive

        than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly and, when applicable, in accordance
        with the product label. This list does not apply to FRP with same sex partners, when this
        is their preferred and usual lifestyle or for subjects who are and will continue to be
        abstinent from penilevaginal intercourse on a long term and persistent basis.

             adequate for endpoint determination.

        NOTE: If the lymph node specimen is determined by the protocol team to be inadequate for
        endpoint determination despite the interventions summarized in LOA #2, the participant will
        be permitted to enroll if adequate adipose tissue is obtained. However, as change in lymph
        node fibrosis remains one of the primary endpoints of this study, it is critical that every
        effort be made to obtain an adequate sample while still trying to minimize complication
        rates.

             therapy (i.e. from concurrent BRAF inhibition plus MEK inhibition to BRAF inhibition
             alone), (b) toxicities are attributed to a class effect, and therefore switch from one

             vemurafenib, or vice versa), will be eligible for enrollment in 9922; in other words,
             patients will be allowed to enroll into the NCI9922 study despite lack of progression

                  participate. This circumstance is unlikely to arise as most women between the
                  ages of 18 to 20 years would be of child-bearing potential (CBP) and excluded on
                  that basis.

        3.1.1 Inclusion Criteria for the Tissue Subset (US sites only) A subset of approximately 24
        participants at US sites will participate in more intensive sampling of vaginal tissue
        during Week 36 (preferred) or Week 44.

        For these participants, the following additional criteria need to be met:

        •Satisfactory Pap results in the 12 calendar months prior to biopsy consistent with Grade 0
        according to the Female Genital Grading Table for Use in Microbicide Studies Addendum 1 to
        the DAIDS Table for Grading Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Version 1.0, December 2004
        (Clarification dated August 2009), or satisfactory evaluation with no treatment required of
        Grade 1 or higher Pap result per American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology
        (ASCCP) guidelines in the 12 calendar months prior to biopsy is required, as indicated.

        If there is no documentation of satisfactory Pap results, and if indicated, the participant
        should be offered to have the test performed by the site prior to enrollment in the Tissue
        Subset. If Pap testing is indicated and participants decline, they are not eligible for the
        Tissue Subset.

             insertion of anything in the vagina (drug, douche, penis, or sex toy) for 3 days prior
             to vaginal biopsy and for 7 days post-biopsy, to minimize risk of HIV-1 infection and
             bleeding complications after the procedure.

          -  Participants must not be pregnant at the time of vaginal sampling, based on pregnancy
             test results from previous visits and on the result of urine pregnancy test performed
             on the same day before the proposed vaginal sampling.

          -  Women undergoing biopsy must have received all prior injections of study product, in
             accordance with the protocol, to be eligible for inclusion.

             study objectives (e.g., at increased risk of cardiovascular vents)
