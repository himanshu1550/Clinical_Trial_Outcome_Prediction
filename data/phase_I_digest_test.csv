        A5327 Eligibility Criteria (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2)

        Step 1 inclusion criteria for both cohorts (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2)

          -  HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or
             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and
             confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than
             the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 p24 antigen, or plasma HIV-1 RNA viral
             load. [NOTE: The term ""licensed"" refers to a FDA-approved kit, which is required for
             all IND studies.] WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control
             and Prevention) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must
             use a test that is different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive
             initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an
             E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or different test principle
             (e.g., indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral
             load.

          -  A documented confirmation of acute HCV infection within 6 months prior to A5327 entry
             or HCV reinfection as described below:

               1. Acute HCV infection was defined as meeting one of the following criteria and
                  exclusion of other causes of acute hepatitis:

                    -  New (<24 weeks prior to initial A5327 entry) ALT elevation to ≥5X upper
                       limit of normal (ULN) OR >250 U/L in patients with documented normal ALT in
                       the preceding 12 months or ≥10X ULN OR >500 U/L in patients with abnormal or
                       no measured ALT baseline in the preceding 12 months with detectable HCV RNA
                       excluding those with any prior positive anti-HCV. OR

                    -  Detectable HCV RNA with prior negative anti-HCV Ab or undetectable HCV RNA
                       within the preceding 6 months.

               2. Acute HCV reinfection was defined by documentation of clearance of prior
                  infection (as evidenced by positive anti-HCV Ab) either spontaneously or after
                  treatment with two negative HCV RNA a minimum of 6 months apart AND meeting one
                  of the following criteria in addition to exclusion of other causes of acute
                  hepatitis:

                    -  New (<24 weeks prior to initial A5327 entry) ALT elevation to ≥5X ULN OR
                       >250 U/L in patients with documented normal ALT in the preceding 12 months
                       or ≥10X ULN OR >500 U/L in patients with abnormal or no measured ALT
                       baseline in the preceding 12 months with detectable HCV RNA. OR

                    -  Positive HCV RNA with prior negative HCV RNA within the preceding 6 months.

          -  HCV RNA confirmed to be detectable >12 weeks after first laboratory evidence of acute
             HCV and still within the <24 week from first laboratory evidence of acute HCV
             infection window. First laboratory evidence of infection was defined as date of first
             elevated liver enzymes or date of first serologic evidence of HCV seroconversion
             and/or viremia (whichever occurs first). [NOTE: If the screening visit occurred less
             than 12 weeks from the first laboratory evidence of infection, then the participant
             was required a pre-entry study visit to confirm detectable HCV RNA at least 12 weeks
             from the first laboratory evidence of infection had passed. It was optimal for this
             pre-entry visit to occur as close as possible to 12 weeks from first laboratory
             evidence to ensure timely treatment. Potential participants who entered screening but
             who had an undetectable HCV RNA (<LLOQ TND) at the pre-entry visit (when required)
             exhibited evidence of possible spontaneous clearance and will not meet the entry
             criteria.]

          -  Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18 kg/m^2

             Female candidates who were pregnant or breastfeeding were not eligible. A male
             candidate who had a pregnant female partner was not eligible for the study.]

          -  When participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, all participants
             must agree to use at least two reliable forms of contraceptive simultaneously while
             receiving protocol-specified medications, and for 6 months after stopping the
             medications. Such methods included:

               -  Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent

               -  Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide

               -  Intrauterine device (IUD)

               -  Tubal ligation

               -  Hormone-based contraceptive (except those containing drospirenone)

        [NOTE: Providers and participants were advised that not all contraceptive choices listed
        above can prevent HIV transmission and that some may actually increase the risk of HIV
        acquisition. Study participants who were sexually active with HIV-1 negative or unknown
        HIV-1 serostatus partners were advised that they needed to consider effective strategies
        for reducing the risk of HIV transmission, as well as meeting the requirement for effective
        contraception during their participation in the study. Study participants discussed
        contraceptive choices and HIV risk reduction methods with their health care provider.]

          -  Participants who were not of reproductive potential (women who had been
             post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months or had undergone hysterectomy
             and/or bilateral oophorectomy or salpingectomy or men who had documented azoospermia
             or undergone vasectomy) were eligible without requiring the use of contraceptives.
             Acceptable documentation of sterilization and menopause was specified below.

               -  Written or oral documentation communicated by clinician or clinician's staff of
                  one of the following:

               -  Physician report/letter

               -  Operative report or other source documentation in the patient record (a

             through 20 months after the final dose of study treatment. Highly effective
             contraception is defined as either:

               1. Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception

               2. Sterilization: Patient has had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman had
                  been confirmed by follow- up hormone level assessment

               3. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of
                  the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female study patients, the
                  vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient

               4. Use a combination of the following (both a + b):

                    1. Placement of a non-hormonal intrauterine device (IUD) or non- hormonal
                       intrauterine system (IUS)

                    2. Barrier method of contraception: Condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                       suppository.

                       Note: Hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, implanted) are
                       not allowed as it cannot be ruled out that the study drug decreases the
                       effectiveness of hormonal contraception.

                       Note: Women are considered post-menopausal and not child bearing potential
                       if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an
                       appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor
                       symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels >40
                       mIU/mL and estradiol <20 pg/mL or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy
                       (with or without hysterectomy) at least six week ago. In the case of
                       oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been
                       confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of
                       child bearing potential.

             with sonidegib. Medications that are strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors should be discontinued
             at least 7 days and strong CYP3A/5 inducers for at least 2 weeks prior to starting
             treatment with sonidegib

             leukemia of ambiguous lineage and meet the following criteria:

               -  Patients must have at least received an appropriate induction therapy regimen.
                  Patients with persistent leukemia after induction therapy, or with recurrence of
                  leukemia at any time during the course of treatment (including allogeneic HSCT)
                  are eligible;

               -  Patients must have rearrangement involving the MLL gene, including reciprocal
                  chromosomal translocations involving 11q23 by FISH, cytogenetic analysis,
                  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or next-generation sequencing (NGS) OR partial
                  tandem duplication (PTD) of MLL by PCR or NGS.

          3. Therapeutic Options: Patients must be ineligible or inappropriate for other treatment
             regimens known to have curative potential.

          4. Performance Level: Karnofsky > 50% for pts > 12 years; Lansky > 50% for pts < 12 years
             of age.

          5. Prior Therapy: Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all
             prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to entering this study.
