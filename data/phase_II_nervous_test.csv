             inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with cabozantinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with cabozantinib; these potential risks may also apply to other
             agents used in this study

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             cabozantinib; in addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be undertaken
             in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated

               -  In addition, the following criteria must be met:

                    -  Patients must have at least one lesion measurable by RECIST version 1.1
                       criteria which has not been previously irradiated

                    -  Patients who have histologic evidence of grade 1 chondrosarcoma only must
                       either be symptomatic from their disease in the opinion of the treating
                       investigator or demonstrate radiographic evidence of disease progression in
                       the 3 months prior to initiation of study treatment

               -  Note: Pathology review and confirmation of diagnosis will occur at the site
                  enrolling the patient on this study

          -  Patients may have been treated with any number of prior systemic therapies. Because
             there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatments for this disease,
             patients who have received no prior systemic therapy are also eligible. However,
             disease must be deemed surgically unresectable

          -  Age >= 18 years. Chondrosarcoma is rarely encountered in children and adolescents

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on effective anti-retroviral
             therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial

          -  For patients with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral
             load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated

          -  Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated
             and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are
             eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load

          -  Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if follow-up brain imaging after
             central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy shows no evidence of progression, if
             patients have been clinically asymptomatic, and if patients have not received systemic

               -  NOTE: If there is a history of prior malignancy, patients must not be receiving
                  other specific treatment for that cancer

          -  Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of
             treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac
             function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be
             eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better

          -  The effects of belinostat and SGI-110 (guadecitabine) or ASTX727 on the developing
             human fetus are unknown. For this reason, and because the DNA methyltransferase
             inhibitor decitabine, the active metabolite of SGI-110 (guadecitabine) and a component
             of ASTX727, is known to be teratogenic, and because belinostat may cause
             teratogenicity and/or embryo-fetal lethality by virtue of targeting actively dividing
             cells, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation and for at least 6 months after the
             last dose of study drugs. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study
             participation, and 3 months after completion of belinostat and SGI-110 (guadecitabine)
             or ASTX727 administration

          -  Patients must be able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent
             document. Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a
             legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be
             eligible

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with dedifferentiated, mesenchymal, or clear cell chondrosarcoma are not
             eligible

          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events (AEs) (i.e., have residual
             toxicities > grade 1) due to prior anti-cancer therapy are not allowed, with the
             exceptions of alopecia and endocrinopathies from prior immunotherapy-based treatments
             that are well-controlled with hormone replacement. In addition, the following time
             periods must elapse between the last dose of prior anti-cancer treatment and
             initiation of study treatment on this protocol:

               -  Cytotoxic chemotherapy or biologic, including immunotherapy: 28 days

               -  Small molecule targeted drug: 21 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter. If 5
                  half-lives is shorter than 21 days, then 21 days applies.

               -  Radiation: 28 days, except for palliative radiation, for which 14 days applies

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Patients with known history of allergic reactions or sensitivity attributed to
             compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to SGI-110 (guadecitabine), its
             active metabolite decitabine, or ASTX727, or belinostat

          -  Chronic use of any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors of UGT1A1 is
             not allowed. Patients must switch to alternative medications 7-14 days before
             treatment with belinostat. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing,
             it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part
             of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the
             risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal
             product

          -  Patients with any known UGT1A1 polymorphism, heterozygous or homozygous, associated
             with reduced function (UGT1A1*6, UGT1A1*28, or UGT1A1*60)

          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness

          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because SGI-110 (guadecitabine) is a
             derivative of decitabine, and ASTX727 contains the agent decitabine, which has the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects, and because belinostat may cause
             teratogenicity and/or embryo-fetal lethality by virtue of targeting actively dividing
             cells. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with SGI-110 (guadecitabine), ASTX727 and
             belinostat, breastfeeding should be discontinued

          -  Prolongation of the heart-rate corrected QT (QTc) interval >= 450 ms (i.e., grade 1 or
             higher) on the screening electrocardiogram (ECG) prior to initiation of study
             treatment. If baseline QTc on screening ECG is >= 450 ms (i.e., grade 1 or higher):

               -  Check potassium and magnesium serum levels, and

               -  Correct any identified hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia and repeat ECG to
                  confirm a QTc interval < 450 ms

          3. Anemia (hemoglobin < 12 g/dL).

          4. Functional iron deficiency:

               1. Serum iron concentration < 40 ug/dL

               2. TSAT < 25%

          1. Age < 18 years.

          2. Active bleeding requiring pRBCs transfusion.

          3. Iron overload (serum ferritin concentration ≥ 1,500 ng/mL). The serum ferritin
             concentration is an acute phase reactant that is increased during critical illness
             regardless of total body iron. Substantial levels of hyperferritinemia (serum ferritin
             concentration > 1,000 ng/dL) were observed in both NCT00450177 and NCT01180894 without
             increased risk of infection and despite both low TSAT and IDE. For these reasons, we
             believe that relative hyperferritinemia (serum ferritin concentration 500 - 1,500
             ng/dL) is neither harmful nor indicative of bone marrow iron availability.

             hemophilia, von Willibrand's disease, or myeloproliferative disease).

          7. Pre-existing hepatic dysfunction (cirrhosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, hepatitis)

          8. Current or recent (within 30 days) use of immunosuppressive agents.

          9. Use of any recombinant human erythropoietin formulation within the previous 30 days.

         10. Known or suspected carcinoma of the breast or prostate.

         11. Nephrosis, the nephrotic phase of nephritis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with active brain metastases are not eligible as lethal intratumoral
             hemorrhages have been reported with erlotinib therapy. Patients with brain metastases
             that have been treated and stable for > 30 days following treatment will be eligible.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or breast feeding will not be entered into the study as
             erlotinib is teratogenic. Pregnancy tests must be obtained in females who are

               -  Investigational Drugs: Patients who are currently receiving another
                  investigational drug are not eligible.

               -  Anti-cancer Agents: Patients who are currently receiving other anti-cancer agents
                  are not eligible.

               -  Anticonvulsants: Patients who are receiving enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants are
                  not eligible (see Appendix 1 for a list of enzyme- inducing anticonvulsants).

               -  Anticoagulants: Use of warfarin is not allowed while on study. Patients already

                  the duration of therapy.

          -  Infection: Patients who have an uncontrolled infection are not eligible.

          -  Drug interactions: Sirolimus and erlotinib are primarily metabolized by the CYP3A4/5
             enzymes. Drug exposure is substantially effected by CYP inhibitors (increased
             exposure) and inducers (decreased exposure). Thus, concomitant administration of
             strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors or inducers is prohibited while on therapy. See Appendix 1
             for a list of these medications. Patients must not have received these medications for
             a minimum of 10 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients who have received prior therapy targeting EGFR with small molecule tyrosine
             kinase inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies are NOT eligible.

             everolimus, sirolimus) is NOT allowed.

          -  Patients who have had major surgery within 3 weeks prior to enrollment are not
             eligible. Procedures such as placement of a central vascular catheter, or limited
             tumor biopsy, are not considered major surgery.

          -  Patients who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with the
             safety monitoring requirements of the study are not eligible.

                  must have short axis greater than or equal to 15 mm) with computed tomography
                  (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and which is suitable for accurate
                  repeated measurements.

               -  Progressive disease: GIST has demonstrated progression as defined by RECIST v1.1
                  within the past 12 months. Patients whose tumors do not meet this criterion, and
                  have a diagnosis of NF1, may enroll on the NF1 Natural History study.

          -  Performance Status: ECOG less than or equal to 2 (Patients greater than or equal to 16
             years of age must have a Karnofsky performance level of greater than or equal to 70%

          -  Prior Therapy: Patients will be eligible if tumor is metastatic, unresectable,
             progressive, or if complete tumor resection is not considered to be feasible without
             substantial risk or morbidity.

               -  Since there is no standard effective chemotherapy for patients with NF1 and GIST,
                  patients may be treated on this trial without having received prior medical
                  therapy directed at their GIST. Patients who have had prior GIST-directed surgery
                  may enroll provided they have measurable disease.

               -  Since selumetinib is not expected to cause substantial myelosuppression, there
                  will be no limit to number of prior myelosuppressive regimen for GIST or other
                  tumor manifestations associated with NF1.

               -  Patients who have received previous investigational agents or biologic therapy,
                  such as tipifarnib, pirfenidone, Peg-Intron, sorafenib, imatinib or other
                  targeted therapies are eligible for enrollment. At least 4 weeks must have
                  elapsed since receiving medical therapy directed at the PN and patients who
                  received previous GIST-directed therapy must either demonstrate progression as
                  defined by RECIST, or be unable to tolerate their previous therapy. Patients who
                  received effects of all prior therapy to less than or equal to grade 1 before
                  entering this study.

               -  Cytotoxic chemotherapy last dose must have been received at least 28 days prior
                  to enrollment, their last dose of biological therapy, immunomodulatory agents,
                  vaccines, differentiating agents, used to treat their cancer at least 7 days
                  prior to enrollment, their last dose of a monoclonal antibody at least 30 days
                  prior to enrollment, and their last dose of any investigational agent at least 30
                  days prior

        to enrollment.

          -  Growth factors that support platelet or white cell number or function must not have
             been administered within the 7 days prior to enrollment.

          -  At least 6 weeks must have elapsed prior to enrollment since the patient received any
             prior radiation therapy.

          -  At least 4 weeks must have elapsed since any surgeries, with evidence of good wound
             healing.

               -  The effects of selumetinib on the developing human fetus at the recommended
                  therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential
                  and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of
                  birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study
                  participation, and for 4 weeks after dosing with selumetinib ceases. Women of
                  child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to entry.
                  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her
                  partner is participating in this study, the patient should inform her treating
                  physician immediately. Please note that the selumetinib

        manufacturer recommends that adequate contraception for male patients should be used for 16
        weeks post-last dose due to sperm life cycle.

          -  All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed
             consent.

          -  Willingness to avoid excessive sun exposure and use adequate sunscreen protection if
             sun exposure is anticipated.

          -  Willingness to avoid the ingestion of grapefruit and Seville oranges (as well as other
             products containing these fruits, e.g. grapefruit juice or marmalade) during the
             study, as these may affect selumetinib metabolism.

          -  Although not a requirement, participants will be asked to also participate in protocol
             10-C-0086 Comprehensive Omics Analysis of Pediatric Solid Tumors and Establishment of
             a Repository for Related Biological Studies. Patients with NF1 will be asked to
             coenroll

        on the NF1 Natural History Study and 08-C-0079: Natural History Study and Longitudinal
        Assessment of Children, Adolescents, and Adults with Neurofibromatosis Type 1.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients with evidence of another malignancy or benign tumor requiring chemotherapy or
             radiation therapy are excluded; however, those patients with a plexiform neurofibroma
             requiring treatment will be eligible as selumetinib has documented activity in
             plexiform neurofibromas.

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of NF1 and GIST who do not meet other eligibility criteria
             may enroll on the NF1 Natural History Study, and will be followed on this study.
             Should they require therapy for GIST based on evidence of progression, they may then
             enroll on study.

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Prior therapy with selumetinib or another specific MEK inhibitor is not permitted.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to selumetinib or other agents used in study.

          -  Previous MEK, RAS, or RAF inhibitor use.

          -  Patients who anticipate the need for surgical intervention within the first three
             cycles (3 months), as surgical intervention during the period of DLT evaluation may
             affect analysis of adherence and/or make the subject inevaluable.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  Patients with the following cardiac conditions are excluded:

               -  Uncontrolled hypertension (Adults: blood pressure [BP] of greater than or equal
                  to 150/95 despite medical support/management. Participants 18 years of age and
                  younger should have a blood pressure less than or equal to 95th percentile for
                  age, height and gender. Preexisting hypertension in adults should be controlled
                  (either with pharmacological or nonpharmacological methods) at the time of
                  enrollment.)

               -  Acute coronary syndrome within 6 months prior to starting treatment

               -  Uncontrolled angina - Canadian Cardiovascular Society grade II-IV despite medical

               -  Known arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy

               -  Baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than or equal to 55%

               -  Previous moderate or severe impairment of left ventricular systolic function
                  (LVEF less than 50% on echocardiography or equivalent on Multi-Gated Acquisition
                  Scan [MUGA]) even if full recovery has occurred.

               -  Severe valvular heart disease

               -  Atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate greater than 100 bpm on ECG at rest

                  serous retinopathy (CSR) or retinal vein occlusion

               -  Intraocular pressure (IOP) greater than 21 mmHg or uncontrolled glaucoma
                  (irrespective of IOP).

               -  Evidence of optic glioma, malignant glioma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath
                  tumor,

               -  Ophthalmological findings secondary to long-standing optic pathway glioma (such
                  as visual loss, optic nerve pallor or strabismus) or long-standing orbitotemporal
                  PN (such as visual loss, strabismus) will NOT be considered a significant
                  abnormality for the purposes of the study

               -  Subjects with any other significant abnormality on ophthalmic examination
                  (performed by an ophthalmologist) should be discussed with the Study Chair for
                  potential eligibility.

          -  Inability to swallow capsules, since capsules cannot be crushed or broken.

          -  Patients with refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal (GI) diseases
             (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease) or significant bowel resection that may
             significantly alter the absorption of study agent

          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or
             inducers of CYP 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4/5 and UGT 1A1 and 1A3, P-glycoprotein, or
             BCRP are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is
             important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal
             product.

          -  No supplementation with vitamin E is permitted because the selumetinib capsules
             contain vitamin E

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of selumetinib on the
             developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. Because there
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with selumetinib.

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with selumetinib. Appropriate studies
             will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when
             indicated.

          -  Ongoing radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, or biologic
             therapy directed at the tumor. Those patients with a plexiform neurofibroma requiring
             treatment will be eligible, as selumetinib has documented activity in plexiform
             neurofibromas.

          -  Patients who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with the
             safety monitoring requirements of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have an established and confirmed diagnosis of AML by World Health
             Organization (WHO) criteria, excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).

          -  Patients must have relapsed or refractory AML, defined as:

               -  Relapsed: >= 5% bone marrow blasts by morphology, reappearance of minimal

                  blood blasts, or development of extramedullary leukemia after one or more prior
                  lines of therapy. Consolidation regimens, including autologous and allogeneic
                  HCT, do not count as a separate prior line of therapy, (e.g., 7+3 followed by
                  cytarabine consolidation followed by allogeneic hematopoietic cell
                  transplantation (HCT) would be considered one prior line of therapy). Note, there
                  is no restriction on the prior number of relapses and prior treatment of relapsed
                  disease is allowed.

               -  Refractory: no complete response (CR) or complete response with incomplete bone
                  marrow recovery (CRi) after two courses of induction therapy (e.g. therapy with
                  the intent to induce remission). Patients 75 years or older, or patients of any
                  age with comorbidities that prevent the use of further intensive chemotherapy,
                  will be eligible if they did not experience CR or CRi after one course of
                  induction therapy.

          -  Patients must have Karnofsky >= 60%.

          -  Patients must have a white blood cell count (WBC) =< 25 x 10^9 cells/L. Hydroxyurea
             and leukapheresis are permitted to satisfy this criterion.

          -  Total bilirubin =< institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) except in patients with
             Gilbert's syndrome or post-transfusion hemolysis. Patients with Gilbert's syndrome or
             post-transfusion hemolysis may enroll if direct bilirubin =< 1.5 x ULN of the direct
             bilirubin.

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT])
             =< 3 x institutional ULN (unless resulting from liver infiltration with leukemia).

          -  Creatinine clearance >= 30 mL/min (If serum creatinine not =< institutional ULN).

          -  Hemoglobin > 8 g/dL. Patients may be transfused to achieve this value.

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients will be eligible for this trial
             if they are on effective antiretroviral regimens utilizing non-CYP-interacting agents,
             they have an undetectable viral load, they have a CD4 count > 350 cells/mm^3, and they
             have no history of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining opportunistic
             infections. If there is evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, HBV
             viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated. If there is
             history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the patient must have been treated and
             have undetectable HCV viral load.

          -  Patients must be willing to submit blood samples for the integrated biomarker.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential (i.e. who are not postmenopausal for at
             least 1 year before screening or are not surgically sterile) must have a negative
             serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to the first study drug administration and
             must agree to practice one highly effective method and one additional effective
             (barrier) method of contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the
             informed consent through 4 months after the last dose of study drug, or agree to
             practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle
             of the patient. Male patients, even if surgically sterilized, must agree to practice
             effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period through 4
             months after the last dose of study drug, or agree to practice true abstinence when
             this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic
             abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods),
             withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of
             contraception.

          -  Patients may have had prior allogeneic HCT at least 3 months prior to randomization
             but should not have evidence of active graft versus host disease or require systemic

          -  Patients must be able to understand and be willing to sign a written informed consent
             document.

          -  Patients with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) will be eligible if they have a
             legal guardian or a close family member available to assist them.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must not have had prior treatment with MLN4924 (pevonedistat), azacitidine,
             or decitabine.

          -  Patients for whom, in the opinion of the treating physician, azacitidine alone is not
             an appropriate treatment will be excluded.

          -  Patients must not have documented active central nervous system (CNS) involvement by
             leukemia. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical
             trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive
             neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other
             adverse events.

          -  Patients must not have received any other investigational or commercial agents or
             therapies administered with the intention to treat their leukemia within 14 days or
             five half-lives (whichever is shorter) of first receipt of study drug, with the
             exception of hydroxyurea used to control WBCs.

          -  All non-hematologic adverse events (AEs) of prior chemotherapy, surgery, or
             radiotherapy, except alopecia, must have resolved to National Cancer Institute (NCI)
             Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade =< 2 prior to starting
             therapy.

          -  Patients must not have a history of other malignancies, except:

               -  Any malignancy that was treated with curative intent, has no known active disease
                  present for >= 1 year before the first dose of study drug, and is felt to be at
                  low risk of recurrence by the treating physician;

               -  Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence
                  of disease;

               -  Adequately treated carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease;

               -  Low-risk prostate cancer after curative surgery.

          -  Patients must not have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of
             similar chemical or biologic composition to MLN4924 (pevonedistat), azacitidine, or
             mannitol.

          -  Clinically significant metabolic enzyme inducers are not permitted during this study,
             or within 14 days before the first dose of study drugs. As part of the
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal
             product.

          -  Patients must not have severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other
             conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, could affect their participation
             in the study.

          -  Pregnant women are ineligible because, as an Nedd8 activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor,
             MLN4924 (pevonedistat) has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with MLN4924 (pevonedistat), breastfeeding must be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with MLN4924 (pevonedistat). These potential
             risks may also apply to azacitidine.

          -  Patients must not have had major surgery within 14 days before the first dose of any
             study drug or be scheduled for surgery during the study period.

          -  Patients must not have uncontrolled coagulopathy or a bleeding disorder unless
             directly attributable to their AML (e.g., disseminated intravascular coagulation).

                  revascularization more than 6 months before screening and who are without cardiac
                  symptoms or those with a prior non-ST elevation MI due to demand-supply mismatch
                  (NSTEM type II) may enroll;

               -  Symptomatic cardiomyopathy;

               -  Clinically significant arrhythmia:

                    -  History of polymorphic ventricular fibrillation or torsade de pointes,

                    -  Permanent atrial fibrillation, defined as continuous atrial fibrillation
                       lasting for >= 6 months;

                    -  Persistent atrial fibrillation, defined as sustained atrial fibrillation
                       lasting > 7 days and/or requiring cardioversion in the 4 weeks before
                       screening;

                    -  Grade 3 atrial fibrillation, defined as symptomatic and incompletely
                       controlled medically, or controlled with a device (e.g., pacemaker) or by
                       ablation;

                    -  Patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or < grade 3 atrial
                       fibrillation for period of at least 6 months are permitted to enroll
                       provided that their heart rate is controlled on a stable regimen;

               -  Moderate or severe pulmonary hypertension.

          -  Patients must not have uncontrolled high blood pressure that cannot be controlled by
             standard therapies.

          -  Patients must not have any life-threatening illness unrelated to cancer.

          -  Patients must not have an active, uncontrolled infection or severe infectious disease,
             (e.g. severe pneumonia, meningitis, or septicemia). Patients with an uncontrolled
             infection must not be enrolled until they have received treatment and the infection is
             under control.

          -  Patients must not have prolonged rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval >= 480 msec,
             calculated according to institutional guidelines.

          -  Patients must not have left ventricular ejection fraction < 40% as assessed by a
             transthoracic echocardiogram or radionuclide angiography within one month prior to
             study entry.

          -  Patients must not have known moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
             interstitial lung disease, or pulmonary fibrosis.

          -  Female patients who intend to donate eggs (ova) during the course of this study or
             within 4 months of receiving their last dose of study drugs are ineligible.

          -  Male patients who intend to donate sperm during the course of this study or within 4
