        therapy specific for HCV infection is required; participants who are anticipated to require
        HCV treatment prior to Week 48 of the Maintenance Phase must be excluded. HCV treatment on
        study may be permitted post Week 48, following consultation with the Medical Monitor.
        Participants with HCV co-infection will be allowed entry into Phase 3 studies if: Liver
        enzymes meet entry criteria; HCV Disease has undergone appropriate work-up, HCV is not

        from any liver biopsy, fibroscan, ultrasound, or other fibrosis evaluation, history of
        cirrhosis or other decompensated liver disease, prior treatment, and timing/plan for HCV
        treatment. In the event that recent biopsy or imaging data is not available or is
        inconclusive, the Fib-4 score will be used to verify eligibility. A Fib-4 score > 3.25 is

             ongoing pregnancy testing; men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact
             with a FCBP, even if they have had a successful vasectomy; a FCBP is a sexually mature

        3.1.1 Inclusion Criteria for the Tissue Subset (US sites only) A subset of approximately 24
        participants at US sites will participate in more intensive sampling of vaginal tissue
        during Week 36 (preferred) or Week 44.

        For these participants, the following additional criteria need to be met:

        •Satisfactory Pap results in the 12 calendar months prior to biopsy consistent with Grade 0
        according to the Female Genital Grading Table for Use in Microbicide Studies Addendum 1 to
        the DAIDS Table for Grading Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Version 1.0, December 2004
        (Clarification dated August 2009), or satisfactory evaluation with no treatment required of
        Grade 1 or higher Pap result per American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology
        (ASCCP) guidelines in the 12 calendar months prior to biopsy is required, as indicated.

        If there is no documentation of satisfactory Pap results, and if indicated, the participant
        should be offered to have the test performed by the site prior to enrollment in the Tissue
        Subset. If Pap testing is indicated and participants decline, they are not eligible for the
        Tissue Subset.

             insertion of anything in the vagina (drug, douche, penis, or sex toy) for 3 days prior
             to vaginal biopsy and for 7 days post-biopsy, to minimize risk of HIV-1 infection and
             bleeding complications after the procedure.

          -  Participants must not be pregnant at the time of vaginal sampling, based on pregnancy
             test results from previous visits and on the result of urine pregnancy test performed
             on the same day before the proposed vaginal sampling.

          -  Women undergoing biopsy must have received all prior injections of study product, in
             accordance with the protocol, to be eligible for inclusion.

             anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase [ALK] gene rearrangements, and EGFR T790M
             mutations) will be ineligible for study participation; if the results of molecular
             studies are not available or known at the time of study registration and subsequently
             become available, such participants will be considered eligible and if deriving
             clinical benefit may continue receiving erlotinib at the discretion of the
