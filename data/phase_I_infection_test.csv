        A5327 Eligibility Criteria (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2)

        Step 1 inclusion criteria for both cohorts (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2)

          -  HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or
             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and
             confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than
             the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 p24 antigen, or plasma HIV-1 RNA viral
             load. [NOTE: The term ""licensed"" refers to a FDA-approved kit, which is required for
             all IND studies.] WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control
             and Prevention) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must
             use a test that is different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive
             initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an
             E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or different test principle
             (e.g., indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral
             load.

          -  A documented confirmation of acute HCV infection within 6 months prior to A5327 entry
             or HCV reinfection as described below:

               1. Acute HCV infection was defined as meeting one of the following criteria and
                  exclusion of other causes of acute hepatitis:

                    -  New (<24 weeks prior to initial A5327 entry) ALT elevation to ≥5X upper
                       limit of normal (ULN) OR >250 U/L in patients with documented normal ALT in
                       the preceding 12 months or ≥10X ULN OR >500 U/L in patients with abnormal or
                       no measured ALT baseline in the preceding 12 months with detectable HCV RNA
                       excluding those with any prior positive anti-HCV. OR

                    -  Detectable HCV RNA with prior negative anti-HCV Ab or undetectable HCV RNA
                       within the preceding 6 months.

               2. Acute HCV reinfection was defined by documentation of clearance of prior
                  infection (as evidenced by positive anti-HCV Ab) either spontaneously or after
                  treatment with two negative HCV RNA a minimum of 6 months apart AND meeting one
                  of the following criteria in addition to exclusion of other causes of acute
                  hepatitis:

                    -  New (<24 weeks prior to initial A5327 entry) ALT elevation to ≥5X ULN OR
                       >250 U/L in patients with documented normal ALT in the preceding 12 months
                       or ≥10X ULN OR >500 U/L in patients with abnormal or no measured ALT
                       baseline in the preceding 12 months with detectable HCV RNA. OR

                    -  Positive HCV RNA with prior negative HCV RNA within the preceding 6 months.

          -  HCV RNA confirmed to be detectable >12 weeks after first laboratory evidence of acute
             HCV and still within the <24 week from first laboratory evidence of acute HCV
             infection window. First laboratory evidence of infection was defined as date of first
             elevated liver enzymes or date of first serologic evidence of HCV seroconversion
             and/or viremia (whichever occurs first). [NOTE: If the screening visit occurred less
             than 12 weeks from the first laboratory evidence of infection, then the participant
             was required a pre-entry study visit to confirm detectable HCV RNA at least 12 weeks
             from the first laboratory evidence of infection had passed. It was optimal for this
             pre-entry visit to occur as close as possible to 12 weeks from first laboratory
             evidence to ensure timely treatment. Potential participants who entered screening but
             who had an undetectable HCV RNA (<LLOQ TND) at the pre-entry visit (when required)
             exhibited evidence of possible spontaneous clearance and will not meet the entry
             criteria.]

          -  Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18 kg/m^2

          -  Screening electrocardiogram (ECG) without clinically significant abnormalities as
             determined by the investigator.

          -  Men and women age ≥ 18 years.

          -  All participants agreed not to participate in a conception process (eg, active attempt
             to become pregnant or to impregnate, sperm donation, in vitro fertilization). [NOTE:
             Female candidates who were pregnant or breastfeeding were not eligible. A male
             candidate who had a pregnant female partner was not eligible for the study.]

          -  When participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, all participants
             must agree to use at least two reliable forms of contraceptive simultaneously while
             receiving protocol-specified medications, and for 6 months after stopping the
             medications. Such methods included:

               -  Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent

               -  Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide

               -  Intrauterine device (IUD)

               -  Tubal ligation

               -  Hormone-based contraceptive (except those containing drospirenone)

        [NOTE: Providers and participants were advised that not all contraceptive choices listed
        above can prevent HIV transmission and that some may actually increase the risk of HIV
        acquisition. Study participants who were sexually active with HIV-1 negative or unknown
        HIV-1 serostatus partners were advised that they needed to consider effective strategies
        for reducing the risk of HIV transmission, as well as meeting the requirement for effective
        contraception during their participation in the study. Study participants discussed
        contraceptive choices and HIV risk reduction methods with their health care provider.]

          -  Participants who were not of reproductive potential (women who had been
             post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months or had undergone hysterectomy
             and/or bilateral oophorectomy or salpingectomy or men who had documented azoospermia
             or undergone vasectomy) were eligible without requiring the use of contraceptives.
             Acceptable documentation of sterilization and menopause was specified below.

               -  Written or oral documentation communicated by clinician or clinician's staff of
                  one of the following:

               -  Physician report/letter

               -  Operative report or other source documentation in the patient record (a

          -  Measurable disease must be present either on physical examination or imaging studies;
             non-measurable disease alone is not acceptable; any tumor mass > 1 cm is acceptable;
             lesions that are considered non-measurable include the following:

          -  Patients with a prior diagnosis of CLL/SLL in central nervous system (CNS) are
             eligible only if the CNS disease has been treated; patients must be neurologically
             stable, without progressive symptoms while off of steroids and anti-convulsants; at
             least 28 days must have elapsed since CNS treatment, and the patient must have
             recovered from all associated toxicities of treatment; patients who have
             transfusion-dependent thrombocytopenia or bleeding/coagulation disorders that may
             increase the risk of life-threatening bleeding are excluded

          -  No evidence of active hepatitis B or C infections (hepatitis B surface antigen
             positive [HBsAg +], hepatitis B deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] positive by polymerase
             chain reaction [PCR], or anti-hepatitis C virus [HCV] antibodies); hepatitis core

             therapy until 6 months after the last rituximab dose

          -  Patients must be non-pregnant and non-nursing; the effects of ibrutinib on the
             developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason and because B- cell receptor
             kinase inhibitors agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are
             known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use
             two forms of contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)
             prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation

          -  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; men

             birth control: one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE
             SAME TIME, at least 28 days before starting lenalidomide; FCBP must also agree to
             ongoing pregnancy testing; men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact
             with a FCBP, even if they have had a successful vasectomy; a FCBP is a sexually mature
             woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has
             not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had
             menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months); all patients must be
             counseled by a trained counselor every 28 days about pregnancy precautions and risks
             of fetal exposure

             participating in this study, during dose interruptions, and for at least 3 days after
             discontinuation of ibrutinib, 28 days after discontinuation of lenalidomide, and 12
             months after discontinuation of rituximab

          -  No history of known human anti-chimeric antibody (HACA) positivity; this does not have
             to be checked prior to enrollment unless clinically indicated

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection or an infection requiring systemic antibiotics, symptomatic congestive heart
             failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements; recent infections
             requiring systemic treatment need to have completed therapy > 14 days before the first
             dose of study drug

          -  Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from this study; pregnant women are
             excluded in this study because ibrutinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the

             hepatitis C antibody must have a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) prior to
             enrollment; (PCR positive patients will be excluded)

          -  History of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage within 6 months prior to enrollment

          -  Any life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction that, in
             the investigator's opinion, could compromise the patient's safety, or put the study at

          -  Persons with tumors known to have biomarkers predictive of resistance to erlotinib
             therapy (specifically Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog [KRAS] mutations,
             anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase [ALK] gene rearrangements, and EGFR T790M
             mutations) will be ineligible for study participation; if the results of molecular
             studies are not available or known at the time of study registration and subsequently
             become available, such participants will be considered eligible and if deriving
             clinical benefit may continue receiving erlotinib at the discretion of the
             investigator and study chair

               -  Total bilirubin < 1.5 x ULN for age or normal conjugated bilirubin

               -  ALT and AST < 3 x ULN (unless attributed to leukemic involvement)

          7. Cardiac Function: Patient must have a shortening fraction (SF) of > 27% or an ejection
             fraction (EF) of > 50% by echocardiogram or MUGA scan.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with CNS 3 disease or symptomatic CNS disease
