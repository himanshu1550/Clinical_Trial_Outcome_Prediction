                         -  Major surgery within 12 weeks before the first dose of study treatment;
                            complete wound healing from major surgery must have occurred 1 month
                            before the first dose of study treatment

                            days before the first dose of study treatment with complete wound
                            healing at least 10 days before the first dose of study treatment;
                            subjects with clinically relevant ongoing complications from prior
                            surgery are not eligible

          -  The subject is unable to swallow tablets

          -  The subject has a corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) >
             500 ms within 28 days before treatment; note: if initial QTcF is found to be > 500 ms,
             two additional electrocardiograms (EKGs) separated by at least 3 minutes should be
             performed; if the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF is =< 500 ms,
             the subject meets eligibility in this regard

          -  The subject is unable or unwilling to abide by the study protocol or cooperate fully
             with the investigator or designee

          -  The subject has had evidence within 2 years of the start of study treatment of another
             malignancy which required systemic treatment

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to cabozantinib

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because cabozantinib is a tyrosine kinase
             inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with cabozantinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with cabozantinib; these potential risks may also apply to other
             agents used in this study

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             cabozantinib; in addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be undertaken
             in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated

          -  Participation to a study involving a medical or therapeutic intervention in the last
             30 days

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Informed consent from patient or patient representative.

          2. Trauma patient

          3. Anemia (hemoglobin < 12 g/dL).

          4. Functional iron deficiency:

               1. Serum iron concentration < 40 ug/dL

               2. TSAT < 25%

               3. Serum ferritin concentration > 28 ng/mL

          1. Age < 18 years.

          2. Active bleeding requiring pRBCs transfusion.

          3. Iron overload (serum ferritin concentration ≥ 1,500 ng/mL). The serum ferritin
             concentration is an acute phase reactant that is increased during critical illness
             regardless of total body iron. Substantial levels of hyperferritinemia (serum ferritin
             concentration > 1,000 ng/dL) were observed in both NCT00450177 and NCT01180894 without
             increased risk of infection and despite both low TSAT and IDE. For these reasons, we
             believe that relative hyperferritinemia (serum ferritin concentration 500 - 1,500
             ng/dL) is neither harmful nor indicative of bone marrow iron availability.

                  not eligible (see Appendix 1 for a list of enzyme- inducing anticonvulsants).

               -  Anticoagulants: Use of warfarin is not allowed while on study. Patients already
                  on warfarin should use alternative anticoagulants while on this study. Warfarin
                  must not have been administered within 7 days of enrollment.

               -  Smoking: Smoking induces CYP3A4/5 enzymes and decreases exposure to sirolimus and
                  erlotinib. Thus, patients must not smoke for 10 days prior to enrollment and for
                  the duration of therapy.

          -  Infection: Patients who have an uncontrolled infection are not eligible.

          -  Drug interactions: Sirolimus and erlotinib are primarily metabolized by the CYP3A4/5
             enzymes. Drug exposure is substantially effected by CYP inhibitors (increased
             exposure) and inducers (decreased exposure). Thus, concomitant administration of
             strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors or inducers is prohibited while on therapy. See Appendix 1
             for a list of these medications. Patients must not have received these medications for
             a minimum of 10 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients who have received prior therapy targeting EGFR with small molecule tyrosine
             kinase inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies are NOT eligible.

          -  Prior treatment with mTOR or TORC1/2 inhibitors (eg, rapamycin, temsirolimus,
             everolimus, sirolimus) is NOT allowed.

          -  Patients who have had major surgery within 3 weeks prior to enrollment are not
             eligible. Procedures such as placement of a central vascular catheter, or limited
             tumor biopsy, are not considered major surgery.

          -  Patients who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with the
             safety monitoring requirements of the study are not eligible.

          -  Patients must not have had prior treatment with MLN4924 (pevonedistat), azacitidine,
             or decitabine.

          -  Patients for whom, in the opinion of the treating physician, azacitidine alone is not
             an appropriate treatment will be excluded.

          -  Patients must not have documented active central nervous system (CNS) involvement by
             leukemia. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical
             trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive
             neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other
             adverse events.

          -  Patients must not have received any other investigational or commercial agents or
             therapies administered with the intention to treat their leukemia within 14 days or
             five half-lives (whichever is shorter) of first receipt of study drug, with the
             exception of hydroxyurea used to control WBCs.

          -  All non-hematologic adverse events (AEs) of prior chemotherapy, surgery, or
             radiotherapy, except alopecia, must have resolved to National Cancer Institute (NCI)
             Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade =< 2 prior to starting
             therapy.

          -  Patients must not have a history of other malignancies, except:

               -  Any malignancy that was treated with curative intent, has no known active disease
                  present for >= 1 year before the first dose of study drug, and is felt to be at
                  low risk of recurrence by the treating physician;

               -  Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence
                  of disease;

               -  Adequately treated carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease;

               -  Low-risk prostate cancer after curative surgery.

          -  Patients must not have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of

          -  Clinically significant metabolic enzyme inducers are not permitted during this study,
             or within 14 days before the first dose of study drugs. As part of the
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal
             product.

          -  Patients must not have severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other
             conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, could affect their participation
             in the study.

          -  Pregnant women are ineligible because, as an Nedd8 activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor,
             MLN4924 (pevonedistat) has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with MLN4924 (pevonedistat), breastfeeding must be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with MLN4924 (pevonedistat). These potential
             risks may also apply to azacitidine.

          -  Patients must not have had major surgery within 14 days before the first dose of any
             study drug or be scheduled for surgery during the study period.

                  symptoms or those with a prior non-ST elevation MI due to demand-supply mismatch
                  (NSTEM type II) may enroll;

               -  Symptomatic cardiomyopathy;

               -  Moderate or severe pulmonary hypertension.

          -  Patients must not have uncontrolled high blood pressure that cannot be controlled by
             standard therapies.

          -  Patients must not have any life-threatening illness unrelated to cancer.

          -  Patients must not have an active, uncontrolled infection or severe infectious disease,
