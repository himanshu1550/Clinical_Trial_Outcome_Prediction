             biomarkers, subjects may be classified as 'never smokers' or 'current smokers
             (abstaining at study visit) + former smokers'.

          -  Subjects who could not refrain from smoking during the time of the visit in the unit.

             at screening or pre-intervention.

        Subjects above this limit may only be included if direct bilirubin is within normal limits,
        which would be consistent with Gilbert's disease.

          -  Has any clinically significant abnormality identified on the medical or laboratory
             evaluation, including 12-lead ECG. A subject with a clinically significant abnormality
             or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for this age group may be
             included only if the Investigator considers that the finding will not introduce
             additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. Any
             questions regarding the significance of abnormal clinical findings in screening
             results should be discussed with the GSK Medical Monitor.

        Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a preventable and treatable disease characterised
        by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually
        progressive and is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to
        noxious particles or gases, primarily caused by cigarette smoking. Although COPD affects
        the lungs, it also produces significant systemic consequences.

             incidental to inclusion in the protocol.

          3. Patients must be 18 years or older for inclusion in this study. Since there is no
             experience with [F-18]FLT in children and it would be inappropriate to study
             individuals under the age of 18 until more safety data is available.

          4. After entry into the study, patients are expected to be followed for at least 2 months
             as part of standard of care.

          5. All patients, or their legal guardians, must sign a written informed consent and HIPAA
             authorization in accordance with institutional guidelines.

          6. The patient, if female, must be postmenopausal for a minimum of one year or surgically
             sterile, or on one of the following methods of birth control for a minimum of one
             month prior to entry into this study: IUD, oral contraceptives, Depo-Provera or
             Norplant. These criteria can be waived at the discretion of the investigator if the
             patient's tumor is considered life threatening and the one month wait required is not
             in the best interest of the patient. Negative pregnancy test is accepted.

          7. Pre-treatment laboratory tests for patients receiving [F-18]FLT must be performed
             within 21 days prior to study entry. These must be less than 4 times below or above
             the upper or lower limit range for the respective laboratory test. The patients have
             Stage IIIB/IV or recurrent NSCLC and therefore many routine laboratory tests may not
             be within the typical normal range. Using a factor of 4 times above or below the upper
             or lower value for the normal range for laboratory test will assure ability to recruit
             patients and maintain safety. In those instances where a value of 4X above the normal
             range would be inappropriate for inclusion (prothrombin time and partial
             thromboplastin time) then a value of 2.5X will be used for these two laboratory tests.
             In those instances when the prothrombin time or partial thromboplastin time are
             greater than 2.5X the upper limit of normal then such a patient would not be enrolled.
             The 4X value will be used for all laboratory values except prothrombin time and
             partial thromboplastin time which cannot be above or below 2.5 times the upper or
             lower limit of normal (Appendix E, [F-18]FLT Laboratory Study Results). A negative
             serum pregnancy test is required within 2 days prior to the PET studies.

          8. Pre-treatment radiological clinical scans/studies (Gd- enhanced MRI or CT to document
             Stage IIIB/IV or recurrent NSCLC) must be performed within 30 days of study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients will be receiving erlotinib (Tarceva) (150 mg/day)and bevacizumab (Avastin)
             (15mg/kg q 21 days) as part of the therapeutic trial. Enrollment may not occur if the
             patient does not meet the enrollment criteria for the therapeutic trial

          2. Patients with known allergic or hypersensitivity reactions to previously administered
             radiopharmaceuticals. Patients with significant drug or other allergies or autoimmune
             diseases may be enrolled at the Investigator's discretion.

          3. Patients who are pregnant or lactating or who suspect they might be pregnant.

          4. Adult patients who require monitored anesthesia for PET scanning.

          5. HIV positive patients due to the previous toxicity noted with FLT.

          6. Claustrophobia or inability to remain stationary within the PET scanner for 90
             minutes.

          2. Previously untreated stage IV disease (AJCC staging system, 6th edition), or,

          3. Patients with residual disease or regional recurrence of head and neck cancer after
             surgery and/or chemotherapy, but with no prior bortezomib, EGFR inhibitor therapy or
             head and neck radiotherapy. All such patients should be eligible to receive full dose
             radiation therapy, and must be evaluated and accepted for treatment by a Radiation
             Oncologist. Prior cisplatin is allowed if administered greater than 3 months earlier.

          4. Patients with no clinically measurable distant disease, or those with asymptomatic
             small distant lesions outside the radiation field of less than or equal to 3cm
             individual or aggregate diameter, but for whom palliation of local and regional
             disease is clinically warranted will be eligible.

          5. Any number of other prior systemic therapies is allowed. Patients must have fully
             recovered from the effects of any prior surgery, or chemotherapy. A minimum time
             period of 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) should elapse between the
             completion of prior chemotherapy and enrollment in the study.

          6. Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are
             currently available on the use of bortezomib in combination with cetuximab or
             cisplatin and radiation in patients <18 years of age, and head and neck cancer in
             children is exceedingly rare, except for those with disorders of DNA damage repair,
             bone marrow or transplant immunosuppression likely to have lower tolerance to these
             drugs and RT, children are excluded from this study.

          7. ECOG performance status 0-1 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to 70 percent).

          8. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/mcL

               -  platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcL

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 times institutional upper limit of
                  normal

               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits

             OR

             creatinine levels above institutional normal.

          9. The effects of bortezomib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason
             and because other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic,
             women of child-bearing potential and men must have agreed to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; prior vasectomy; tubal
             ligation or abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study
             participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

         10. Adequate cognitive and neurologic function to protect against and detect and report
             toxicities experienced, and to understand and to sign a written informed consent
             document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Patients with previously untreated nasopharyngeal cancer (any stage) will be excluded,
             but patients with recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma will be eligible.

          2. Prior treatment with radiation to the head and neck, or systemic EGFR inhibitors or
             bortezomib is not allowed.

          3. Patients who have had chemotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or
             mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse
             events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          4. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          5. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          6. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to bortezomib, cetuximab, cisplatin or other agents used in study.

          7. Patients with greater than or equal to grade 2 peripheral sensory neuropathy because
             bortezomib can cause irreversible worsening and a painful type of chemotherapy
             associated peripheral neuropathy.

          8. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          9. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because bortezomib, cetuximab and
             cisplatin have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with bortezomib, cetuximab and cisplatin, breastfeeding should
             be discontinued if the mother is treated with bortezomib, cetuximab and cisplatin.
             These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.

         10. HIV-positive patients or patients on any antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because
             of the potential for possible pharmacodynamic interactions with bortezomib, cetuximab
             and cisplatin, particularly bone marrow and mucosal toxicity, which could affect the
             MTD. These patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy.

             curative or life-prolonging potential

          -  Aged 18 years or more

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1

          -  Expected survival longer than 3 months from enrollment in the study

             plasma concentrations

          -  Willingness to have serial skin punch biopsies obtained and, if feasible, to have
             serial biopsies of tumor tissue obtained before and following the first dose of
             MLN8054 Note: Once the relationship between drug exposure and inhibition of Aurora A
             kinase activity has been established, patients subsequently enrolled in the study will
             not be required to undergo either tumor or skin biopsies.

             8. Recovered from the reversible effects of prior antineoplastic therapy with at least
             4 weeks elapsed since the last exposure to cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy and
             at least 6 weeks elapsed since exposure to nitrosoureas or mitomycin C. Patients
             treated with fully human monoclonal antibodies must not have received treatment with
             such antibodies for at least 6 weeks, and those treated with chimeric monoclonal
             antibodies must not have received treatment with such antibodies for at least 4 weeks.
             Patients treated with noncytotoxic small molecule drugs (eg, tyrosine kinase
             inhibitors such as Tarceva and hormonal agents such as FemaraÂ®) must not have received
             treatment with these drugs for at least 2 weeks before the first dose of MLN8054 is

             spermicide) during the study and for 3 months after the last dose of study treatment.

          -  Female patients must be postmenopausal, surgically sterilized, or willing to use
             reliable methods of birth control (eg, a hormonal contraceptive, an intrauterine
             device, diaphragm with spermicide, or abstinence) during the study and for 3 months
             after the last dose of study treatment. They should inform any male sexual partner to
             use an appropriate method of barrier contraception (ie, condoms) as well.

          -  Able to give informed consent before the conduct of any study-related procedure not
             part of normal medical care and able to comply with the protocol

             Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (eg, Tarceva and IressaÂ®) are considered noncytotoxic
             compounds.

          -  Prior treatment with high-dose chemotherapy, defined as chemotherapy requiring the use
             of peripheral blood or bone marrow stem cell support for hematopoietic reconstitution

             hematopoietically active bone marrow

          -  Clinical and/or radiographic evidence of cerebral metastases. However, patients who
             have a history of CNS metastasis but have no radiographic or clinical evidence of
             residual tumor (eg, following complete surgical resection) are not excluded from
             participation in this study.

          -  Absolute neutrophil count <1.5 x 106/ul; platelet count <100 x 106/ul.

             aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >2 times the ULN, and alkaline
             phosphatase (ALP) >2 times the ULN. Both the AST and ALP may be elevated up to 5 times
             the ULN if their elevation can be reasonably ascribed to the presence of metastatic
             disease to liver and/or to bone; however, the ALT must in all circumstances be <2
             times the ULN.

          -  Abnormalities or arrhythmias on 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that, in the opinion
             of the investigator, are considered to be clinically significant

             therapy) to control systemic disease or bulk CNS disease will be eligible, provided
             the therapy is not a phase I agent, an agent which significantly penetrates the CSF or
             an agent known to have serious unpredictable CNS side effects.

          2. (1. continued) No other cytotoxic chemotherapies are allowed (non-cytotoxic therapies
             such as herceptin, tarceva, arimidex etc are allowed at the investigator's

             competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible
             to its toxicities).

          5. Concurrent systemic steroid therapy

          6. History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to any of the agents used in

          1. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          2. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          3. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          4. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to RAD001 or other agents used in the study.

          5. Patients receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of
             the isoenzyme CYP3A are ineligible. Lists including medications and substances known
             or with the potential to interact with the CYP3A isoenzymes are provided in the
             appendix.

          6. Patients receiving chronic treatment with systemic steroids or other immunosuppressive
             agents are ineligible.

          7. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to RAD001 (everolimus) or other rapamycin
             (sirolimus, temsirolimus) or its excipients.

          8. Impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may
             significantly alter the absorption of RAD001 (e.g. ulcerative disease; uncontrolled
             nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; malabsorption syndrome or small bowel resection).

          9. Patients with active bleeding diathesis or patients on oral anti-vitamin K agent
             (excluding low dose warfarin).

         10. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, severely impaired lung function or psychiatric illness/social situations
             that would limit compliance with study requirements Severely impaired lung function is
             defined as spirometry and DLCO that is 50% of the normal predicted value and /or O2
             saturation that is 88% or less on room air.

         11. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because RAD001 is a mTOR inhibitor with
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with RAD001, breastfeeding should be discontinued. These potential risks may
             also apply to other agents used in this study.

         12. HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with RAD001. In addition, these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

                  metastases to be treated as part of this study must be 2.5cm or larger in maximal
                  diameter. The brain metastasis/es to be treated may not be more than 4cm in
                  maximal diameter, as assessed by CT or MRI scan. The brain metastasis may either
                  be un-resected or partially resected, provided that the target lesion (which may
                  include a resection cavity) remains between 2.5 and 4cm in diameter, as defined
                  in section 6. Whole brain radiation therapy may or may-not have been delivered

          1. Patients must have histologically confirmed (by the NIH pathology department) solid
             tumor malignancy or lymphoma that is metastatic or unresectable for which standard
             curative measures do not exist, or are associated with minimal patient survival
             benefit.

          2. Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease.

          3. Patients must have completed any chemotherapy or biologic therapy greater than or
             equal to 4 weeks prior to entering the study (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C,
             or UCN-01). Patients must be greater than or equal to 2 weeks since any prior
             administration of study drug in a exploratory IND/Phase Zero study. Patients must be
             greater than or equal to 1 month since any prior radiation or major surgery. Patients
             must have recovered to eligibility levels from prior toxicity or adverse events.
             However, patients receiving bisphosphonates for any cancer or undergoing androgen
             deprivation therapy for prostate cancer are eligible for this therapy.

          4. Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

          5. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to
             2 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to 60%).

          6. Life expectancy greater than 3 months.

          7. Patients must have normal or adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/microL.

               -  Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/microL.

               -  Total bilirubin within less than or equal to 1.5 normal institutional limits.

               -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 x institutional upper limit of
                  normal.

               -  creatinine less than 1.5 x upper limit of normal

             OR

             -creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for patients with
             creatinine levels greater than or equal to 1.5 times upper limit of normal.

             We will allow patients with Gilbert s syndrome with total bilirubin up to 2.5 mg/dL.

          8. The effects of batracylin on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior to study entry, for
             the duration of study participation, and for 2 months after discontinuation from the
             study. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test in order
             to be eligible. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with batracylin, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with batracylin.

          9. Patients must have a slow acetylator NAT2 genotype defined as NAT2 5, NAT2 6, NAT2 7,
             or NAT2 14. Theoretically slow acetylators will have lower Ac-BAT concentrations. A
             number of different polymorphisms in the NAT2 give rise to amino acid substitutions,
             and these have been demonstrated to result in absence of catalytic activity in vitro
             (http://www.louisville.edu/medschool/pharmacology/NAT.html). Screening for the four
             variant alleles (NAT2 5, NAT2 6, NAT2 7 and NAT2 14) results in the detection of the
             vast majority of Caucasian slow acetylators, though additional alleles are also common
             in other ethnic groups. The precise percentage of slow acetylators also varies with
             ethnic origin, ranging from 90% in North Africans to less than 10% in many Asian
             populations, with a frequency of 50% in Caucasians. The incidence of fast acetylators
             (potentially with increased toxicity) is as follow: 50% among Caucasians, 50% among
             Africans, 90% among Japanese, and 20% among Egyptians. We plan to select the slow
             acetylators NAT2 subjects and determine the batracylin MTD in this population. The
             screening will occur prior to the study start and before patients sign the informed
             consent form. Cogenics will be performing the NAT2 analysis.

         10. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Patients receiving any other investigational agents.

          2. Patients with known brain metastases are excluded from this clinical trial, with the
             exception of patients whose brain metastatic disease status has remained stable for
             greater than or equal to 6 months after treatment of the brain metastases, without
             steroids or anti-seizure medications. These patients may be enrolled at the discretion
             of the principal investigator.

          3. Patients with clinically significant illnesses which could compromise participation in
             the study, including, but not limited to, active or uncontrolled infection, immune
             deficiencies or confirmed diagnosis of HIV infection, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C,
             uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart
             failure, unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months,
             uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements.
