        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Informed consent from patient or patient representative.

          2. Trauma patient

          3. Anemia (hemoglobin < 12 g/dL).

          4. Functional iron deficiency:

               1. Serum iron concentration < 40 ug/dL

               2. TSAT < 25%

               3. Serum ferritin concentration > 28 ng/mL

          5. < 72 hours from ICU admission.

          6. Expected ICU length of stay ≥ 7 days.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Age < 18 years.

          2. Active bleeding requiring pRBCs transfusion.

          3. Iron overload (serum ferritin concentration ≥ 1,500 ng/mL). The serum ferritin
             concentration is an acute phase reactant that is increased during critical illness
             regardless of total body iron. Substantial levels of hyperferritinemia (serum ferritin
             concentration > 1,000 ng/dL) were observed in both NCT00450177 and NCT01180894 without
             increased risk of infection and despite both low TSAT and IDE. For these reasons, we
             believe that relative hyperferritinemia (serum ferritin concentration 500 - 1,500
             ng/dL) is neither harmful nor indicative of bone marrow iron availability.

             culture with ≥ 105 colony forming units per mL.

          5. Chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosis, rheumatoid
             arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis).

          6. Pre-existing hematologic disorders (e.g., thalassemia, sickle cell disease,
             hemophilia, von Willibrand's disease, or myeloproliferative disease).

          7. Pre-existing hepatic dysfunction (cirrhosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, hepatitis)

          8. Current or recent (within 30 days) use of immunosuppressive agents.

          9. Use of any recombinant human erythropoietin formulation within the previous 30 days.

         10. Known or suspected carcinoma of the breast or prostate.

         11. Nephrosis, the nephrotic phase of nephritis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with active brain metastases are not eligible as lethal intratumoral
             hemorrhages have been reported with erlotinib therapy. Patients with brain metastases
             that have been treated and stable for > 30 days following treatment will be eligible.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or breast feeding will not be entered into the study as
             erlotinib is teratogenic. Pregnancy tests must be obtained in females who are
             post-menarchal. Post-menarchal females with HCG secreting tumors will be excluded as
             pregnancy can't be excluded. Males or females of reproductive potential may not
             participate unless they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method for the
             duration of the study.

          -  Concomitant medications

               -  Investigational Drugs: Patients who are currently receiving another
                  investigational drug are not eligible.

               -  Anti-cancer Agents: Patients who are currently receiving other anti-cancer agents
                  are not eligible.

               -  Anticonvulsants: Patients who are receiving enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants are
                  not eligible (see Appendix 1 for a list of enzyme- inducing anticonvulsants).

               -  Anticoagulants: Use of warfarin is not allowed while on study. Patients already
                  on warfarin should use alternative anticoagulants while on this study. Warfarin
                  must not have been administered within 7 days of enrollment.

               -  Smoking: Smoking induces CYP3A4/5 enzymes and decreases exposure to sirolimus and
                  erlotinib. Thus, patients must not smoke for 10 days prior to enrollment and for
                  the duration of therapy.

          -  Infection: Patients who have an uncontrolled infection are not eligible.

          -  Drug interactions: Sirolimus and erlotinib are primarily metabolized by the CYP3A4/5
             enzymes. Drug exposure is substantially effected by CYP inhibitors (increased
             exposure) and inducers (decreased exposure). Thus, concomitant administration of
             strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors or inducers is prohibited while on therapy. See Appendix 1
             for a list of these medications. Patients must not have received these medications for
             a minimum of 10 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients who have received prior therapy targeting EGFR with small molecule tyrosine
             kinase inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies are NOT eligible.

          -  Prior treatment with mTOR or TORC1/2 inhibitors (eg, rapamycin, temsirolimus,
             everolimus, sirolimus) is NOT allowed.

          -  Patients who have had major surgery within 3 weeks prior to enrollment are not
             eligible. Procedures such as placement of a central vascular catheter, or limited
             tumor biopsy, are not considered major surgery.

          -  Patients who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with the
             safety monitoring requirements of the study are not eligible.

             have no history of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining opportunistic
             infections. If there is evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, HBV
             viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated. If there is
             history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the patient must have been treated and
             have undetectable HCV viral load.

          -  Patients must be willing to submit blood samples for the integrated biomarker.

             (barrier) method of contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the
             informed consent through 4 months after the last dose of study drug, or agree to
             practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle

             effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period through 4
             months after the last dose of study drug, or agree to practice true abstinence when
             this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic
             abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods),
             withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of
             contraception.

          -  Patients may have had prior allogeneic HCT at least 3 months prior to randomization

             an appropriate treatment will be excluded.

          -  Patients must not have documented active central nervous system (CNS) involvement by
             leukemia. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical
             trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive
             neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other
             adverse events.

          -  Patients must not have received any other investigational or commercial agents or
             therapies administered with the intention to treat their leukemia within 14 days or

               -  Any malignancy that was treated with curative intent, has no known active disease
                  present for >= 1 year before the first dose of study drug, and is felt to be at
                  low risk of recurrence by the treating physician;

               -  Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence
                  of disease;

          -  Clinically significant metabolic enzyme inducers are not permitted during this study,
             or within 14 days before the first dose of study drugs. As part of the
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal

             MLN4924 (pevonedistat) has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with MLN4924 (pevonedistat), breastfeeding must be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with MLN4924 (pevonedistat). These potential
             risks may also apply to azacitidine.

          -  Patients must not have had major surgery within 14 days before the first dose of any
             study drug or be scheduled for surgery during the study period.

                       fibrillation for period of at least 6 months are permitted to enroll
                       provided that their heart rate is controlled on a stable regimen;

               -  Moderate or severe pulmonary hypertension.

          -  Patients must not have uncontrolled high blood pressure that cannot be controlled by
             standard therapies.
