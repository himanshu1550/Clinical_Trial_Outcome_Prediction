        HCV treatment prior to Week 48 of the Maintenance Phase must be excluded. HCV treatment on
        study may be permitted post Week 48, following consultation with the Medical Monitor.

        enzymes meet entry criteria; HCV Disease has undergone appropriate work-up, HCV is not

        from any liver biopsy, fibroscan, ultrasound, or other fibrosis evaluation, history of
        cirrhosis or other decompensated liver disease, prior treatment, and timing/plan for HCV
        treatment. In the event that recent biopsy or imaging data is not available or is

        cirrhosis with or without hepatitis viral co-infection. - Ongoing or clinically relevant
        pancreatitis. - All participants will be screened for syphilis (rapid plasma reagin [RPR]).
        Participants with untreated syphilis infection, defined as a positive RPR without clear
        documentation of treatment, are excluded. Participants with a positive RPR test who have
        not been treated may be rescreened at least 30 days after completion of antibiotic
        treatment for syphilis. - Ongoing malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma, basal
        cell carcinoma, or resected, non-invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or cervical,

        prior to enrollment. - Any condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may
        interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of the drug or render
        the participant unable to receive study medication. - History or presence of allergy or
        intolerance to the study drugs or their components or drugs of their class. In addition, if
        heparin is used during pharmacokinetic sampling (PK) sampling, participants with a history

        systemic corticosteroids, interleukins, or interferons). Note: Participants using
        short-term (e.g. =<21 day) systemic corticosteroid treatment, topical, inhaled or
        intranasal corticosteroids are eligible for enrollment. - Treatment with an HIV-1
        immunotherapeutic vaccine within 90 days of Screening. - Treatment with any agent, except

        excluded from the study if local provision of an alternate NRTI backbone is not possible).
        - Any verified Grade 4 laboratory abnormality. A single repeat test is allowed during the
        Screening Phase to verify a result. - Any acute laboratory abnormality at Screening, which,
        in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude the participant's participation in the
        study of an investigational compound. - Participant has estimated creatinine clearance <50
        mL/min/1.73m^2 via the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI)

             psychiatric/psychological condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the

             may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the
             Investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.

         13. In the case of incidental findings the patient and his/her treating physician will be
             informed and asked to undertake action if necessary. If a patient does not want to be
