        requirement.

        Adequate contraception is defined as continuous use of either two barrier methods (e.g.,
        condom and spermicide or diaphragm with spermicide) or a hormonal contraceptive. Acceptable
        hormonal contraceptives include the following: a) contraceptive implant (such as Norplant®)

        Subject is able and agrees to remain off prior antipsychotic medication for the duration of
        the study.

        Subject has had a stable living arrangement at the time of screening and agrees to return
        to a similar living arrangement after discharge, if hospitalized. This criterion is not
        meant to exclude subjects who have temporarily left a stable living arrangement (e.g., due
        to psychosis). Such subjects remain eligible to participate in this protocol. Chronically
        homeless subjects should not be enrolled.

        Subject is in good physical health on the basis of medical history, physical examination,
        and laboratory screening.

        Subject who requires concomitant medication treatment with the following agents may be
        included if they have been on stable doses (i.e., minor adjustments only) for the specified
        times: 1) antidepressant agents (except fluvoxamine) and/or mood stabilizers (except
        carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine) must be stable for at least 30 days prior to open-label
        baseline, 2) oral hypoglycemics must be stable for at least 30 days prior to screening, 3)
        antihypertensive agents must be stable for at least 30 days prior to screening, and 4)

             of two excursions (except during the last 4 weeks of the open-label phase) assessed at
             weekly study visits:

             • An excursion is defined as a PANSS total score up to a maximum of 80 and/or a CGI-S
             score up to a maximum of 4 and/or a PANSS Positive subscale item score up to a maximum

        might confound the results of the study. Subjects with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
        seropositivity (or history of seropositivity) will be excluded.

        Note: Active medical conditions that are minor or well-controlled are not exclusionary if
        they do not affect risk to the subject or the study results. In cases in which the impact
        of the condition upon risk to the subject or study results is unclear, the Medical Monitor
        should be consulted. Any subject with a known cardiovascular disease or condition (even if
        controlled) must be discussed with the Medical Monitor before being screened.

        Subject has evidence of any chronic organic disease of the CNS such as tumors,
        inflammation, and active seizure disorder, vascular disorder, Parkinson's disease,
        Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia, myasthenia gravis, or other degenerative
        processes. In addition, subject must not have a history of mental retardation or persistent
        neurological symptoms attributable to serious head injury. Note: Past history of febrile
        seizures, drug-induced seizures, or alcohol withdrawal seizures is not exclusionary.

        Note: Past history of febrile seizures, drug-induced seizures, or alcohol withdrawal
        seizures is not exclusionary.

        Subject demonstrates evidence of acute hepatitis, clinically significant chronic hepatitis,
        or evidence of clinically significant impaired hepatic function through clinical and
        laboratory evaluation.

        Note: Subjects with serum alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) levels
        ≥ 3 times the upper limit of the reference ranges provided by the central laboratory
        require retesting. If on retesting, the laboratory value remains ≥ 3 times the upper limit,
        such subjects will be discussed with the Medical Monitor for enrollment consideration.

        Subject has a history of stomach or intestinal surgery or any other condition that could
        interfere with or is judged by the Investigator to interfere with absorption, distribution,
        metabolism, or excretion of study drug.

        Subject with Type 1 or Type 2 insulin-dependent diabetes.

        Subject with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes during screening. Subject with Type 2 diabetes
        is eligible for study inclusion if the following condition is met at screening:

        if a subject is currently being treated with oral anti-diabetic medication(s), the dose
        must have been stable for at least 4 weeks prior to screening. Such medication may be
        adjusted or discontinued during the study, as clinically indicated.

        Subject has any abnormal laboratory parameter at screening that indicates a clinically
        significant medical condition as determined by the Investigator. Subjects with a fasting
        blood glucose at screening ≥ 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) or HbA1c ≥ 7.0% will be excluded.

        Note: Subjects with random (non-fasting) blood glucose at screening ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1
        mmol/L) must be retested in a fasted state.

        Subject has a prolactin concentration > 100 ng/mL at screening or has a history of
        pituitary adenoma.

        Subject has a history of malignancy < 5 years prior to signing the informed consent, except
        for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer or in situ cervical cancer.
        Pituitary tumors of any duration are excluded.

        Subject is judged to be resistant to antipsychotic treatment defined as any one of the
        following:

          1. failure to respond to > 2 marketed antipsychotic agents, given at an adequate dose and
             for an adequate duration (within the past 2 years)

          2. history of treatment with clozapine for refractory psychosis Subject is unlikely to
             achieve a stable condition for ≥ 12 weeks during the open-label lurasidone phase based
             on the totality of evidence from the psychiatric history and/or the current
             presentation.

        Subject is receiving an antipsychotic medication above the maximum recommended
        (country-specific) dose at or prior to screening and, in the judgment of the Investigator,
        is unlikely to respond to standard doses of lurasidone.

        Subject has received depot antipsychotics unless the last injection was at least one
        treatment cycle or at least 30 days (whichever is longer) prior to the screening phase.

        Subject has received treatment with MAO inhibitors within 14 days prior to the screening
        phase.

        Subject requires treatment with any potent CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers during the study
        (see Appendix 3).

        Subject has received electroconvulsive therapy treatment within the 3 months prior to
        screening or is expected to require electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) during the study.

        Subject has a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Subject exhibits evidence of
        severe tardive dyskinesia, severe dystonia, or any other severe movement disorder. Severity
        will be determined by the Investigator.

        Subject has a history of alcohol or substance abuse (DSM-IV-TR criteria) within 3 months
        prior to screening or alcohol or substance dependence (DSM-IV-TR criteria) within 12 months
        prior to screening. The only exceptions include caffeine or nicotine abuse/dependence.

        Subject tests positive for drugs of abuse at screening. In the event a subject tests
        positive for cannabinoids (tetrahydrocannabinol), the Investigator will evaluate the
        subject's ability to abstain from using this drug during the study. This information will
        be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to study enrollment.

        Subject had a history or presence of an abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), which in the
        Investigator's opinion is clinically significant (Medical Monitor may be consulted to
        determine clinical significance).

        Subject has poor peripheral venous access that will limit the ability to draw blood as
        judged by the Investigator.

        Subject has a history of hypersensitivity to more than 2 distinct chemical classes of drug
        (e.g., sulfas and penicillins).

        Subject was screened or washed out previously more than three times for this study.

        Subject is currently participating, or has participated in, a study with an investigational
        or marketed compound or device within 3 months prior to signing the informed consent, or
        has participated in 2 or more studies within 12 months prior to signing the informed
        consent.

        Subject is homeless or did not have a stable residence for the 3 months prior to the
        screening phase.

        Subject is unable to cooperate with any study procedures, unlikely to adhere to the study
        procedures and keep appointments, in the opinion of the Investigator, or was planning to
        relocate during the study.

        Subject requires guardianship under the laws of his/her country.

        Double-blind - Subjects who in the Investigator's judgment have not been compliant with
        study medication during the open-label stabilization phase.

             presence of continuous clinical disease worsening over a period of at least 3 months.
             Patients with these conditions may also have superimposed relapses, but are
             distinguished from relapsing-remitting patients by the lack of clinically stable
             periods or clinical improvement.

             history, physical examination, laboratory testing, or due to prior immunosuppressive
             or immunomodulating treatment.

          5. Subjects for whom MRI is contraindicated, i.e., have pacemakers or other
             contraindicated implanted metal devices, have suffered or are at risk for side effects
             from gadolinium (Gd), or have claustrophobia that cannot be medically managed.

          6. History of any clinically significant (as determined by the Investigator) cardiac,
             endocrinologic, hematologic, hepatic, immunologic, metabolic, urologic, pulmonary,
             neurologic, dermatologic, psychiatric, renal, or other major disease that would
             preclude participation in a clinical trial.

          7. History of malignant disease, including solid tumors and hematologic malignancies
             (with the exception of basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin that have
             been completely excised and are considered cured).

          8. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

                  or without radiation into the lower limb that must display a topography
                  compatible with the L1 to S1 territory and/or respective sensory or motoric
                  impairments.

               2. Patient must have chronic neuropathic low back pain with a minimum intensity of
                  ""40 mm"" (moderate) or greater on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS; 100-mm) at
                  screening, and an average of ""40 mm"" or more at baseline (based on prior 7 days).

               3. The onset of pain has occurred at least three months, but not longer than 3
                  years, prior to the screening visit, as assessed by the investigator in the
                  patient's medical history.

               4. Patient is affected by current neuropathic pain (pain provoked by a lesion of the
                  peripheral nervous system). The diagnosis should be made by a
                  neurologist/anaesthesiologist/pain specialist and based on history, clinical
                  evaluation and/or laboratory findings (rule out systemic cause, e.g.,
                  hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, nephropathy, diabetes [MNSI score >2]) in
                  accordance with the taxonomy of the diagnostic criteria documented in the
                  International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) Classification of Chronic
                  Pain. A neurological disease must be directly correlated with pain, including
                  pain due to spinal root compression.

                  If radiologic data supporting the diagnosis had been obtained previously it
                  should be documented in the patient's records. In case radiologic examinations
                  are not available, the Investigator should consider performing these
                  examinations, if necessary to support the diagnosis, during the screening phase.

               5. Patient has one of the following causes of neuropathic low back pain: Non-cancer
                  lumbar pain due to compression radiculopathy or post-traumatic/post-surgical
                  lumbar radiculopathy.

               6. Patient's low back pain has a clear neuropathic component, as indicated by a
                  rating on the Pain Detect Questionnaire (PD-Q) of greater than 18.

               7. Patient is 18-85 years of age, inclusive.

               8. Patient is willing and able to understand and sign an approved Informed Consent
                  Form.

             aged < 50 years and post-menopausal condition started less than 24 months prior,
             and/or post-menopausal status has not been confirmed by determination of the serum
             levels of FSH and 17-β estradiol; or fecund and not practicing double contraception
             method (e.g., hormonal contraceptive plus barrier method).

             2. Patients with any other cause of peripheral or central neuropathic pain (including
             psychogenic and nociceptive pain), pain due to metabolic (including diabetes; MNSI
             score > 2) infectious or proliferative diseases, or pain due to any condition that is
             as severe as the neuropathic pain.

             3. Patients with a history of migrating pain and former mononeuropathy or neuralgias
             in other anatomical territories.
