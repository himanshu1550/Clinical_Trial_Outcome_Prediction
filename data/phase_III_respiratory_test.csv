             limited to) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sarcoidosis, interstitial lung
             disease, cystic fibrosis, clinically significant bronchiectasis and active
             tuberculosis.

          -  Patients with Type I diabetes or uncontrolled Type II diabetes.

          -  Patients who, either in the judgment of the investigator or the responsible Novartis

          -  Patients who have not achieved an acceptable spirometry result at Visit 101 in
             accordance with ATS/ERS criteria for acceptability and repeatability. A one-time
             repeat spirometry is allowed in an ad-hoc visit scheduled as close as possible from
             the first attempt (but not on the same day) if the spirometry did not qualify due to
             ATS/ERS criteria at Visit 101 and/or Visit 102. If the patient fails the repeat
             assessment, the patient may be rescreened once, provided the patient returns to the
             required treatment as per inclusion criteria 4.

          -  Patients unable to use the Concept1 dry powder inhaler, Accuhaler or a metered dose

          -  COPD Diagnosis: An established clinical history of COPD in accordance with the
             definition by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society.

          -  Smoking History: Current or former cigarette smokers with a history of cigarette
             smoking of >=10 pack-years at Screening (Visit 1) [number of pack years = (number of
             cigarettes per day divided by 20) x number of years smoked (e.g., 20 cigarettes per
             day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years)]. Previous smokers are
             defined as those who have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Screening
             (Visit 1). Note: Pipe and/or cigar use cannot be used to calculate pack-year history.

             Screening (Visit 1). Notes: Percent predicted will be calculated using the European
             Respiratory Society Global Lung Function Initiative reference equations; A documented
             history of a COPD exacerbation (e.g., medical record verification) is a medical record
             of worsening COPD symptoms that required systemic/oral corticosteroids and/or
             antibiotics (for a moderate exacerbation) or hospitalisation (for a severe
             exacerbation). Prior use of antibiotics alone does not qualify as an exacerbation
             history unless the use was associated with treatment of worsening symptoms of COPD,
             such as increased dyspnoea, sputum volume, or sputum purulence (colour). Subject

             with other respiratory disorders (e.g. clinically significant: bronchiectasis,
             sarcoidosis, lung fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung diseases) are
             excluded if these conditions are the primary cause of their respiratory symptoms.

             as endobronchial valves) within the 12 months prior to Screening (Visit 1).

          -  Risk Factors for Pneumonia: immune suppression (e.g. advanced human immune deficiency
             virus (HIV) with high viral load and low cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count,
             Lupus on immunosuppressants that would increase risk of pneumonia) or other risk
             factors for pneumonia (e.g. neurological disorders affecting control of the upper
             airway, such as Parkinson's Disease, Myasthenia Gravis). Notes: Subjects at a high
             risk for pneumonia (e.g. very low body mass index (BMI), severely malnourished or very
             low FEV1) will only be included at the discretion of the investigator.

          -  Pneumonia and/or moderate or severe COPD exacerbation that has not resolved at least
             14 days prior to Screening (Visit 1) and at least 30 days following the last dose of

             significant abnormality not believed to be due to the presence of COPD, or another
             condition that would hinder the ability to detect an infiltrate on chest x-ray (e.g.
             significant cardiomegaly, pleural effusion or scarring). All subjects will have a
             chest x-ray at Screening (Visit 1) [or historical radiograph or computerised
             tomography (CT) scan obtained within 3 months prior to Screening (Visit 1). Notes:
             Subjects who have experienced pneumonia and/or moderate or severe COPD exacerbation
             within 3 months of Screening (Visit 1) must provide a post pneumonia/exacerbation
             chest x-ray or have a chest x-ray conducted at Screening (Visit 1); For sites in
             Germany: If a chest x-ray (or CT scan) within 3 months prior to Screening (Visit 1) is
             not available, approval to conduct a diagnostic chest x-ray will need to be obtained
             from the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BFS).

          -  Other diseases/abnormalities: Subjects with historical or current evidence of
             clinically significant cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric, renal, hepatic,
             immunological, gastrointestinal, urogenital, nervous system, musculoskeletal, skin,
             sensory, endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or
             hematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled. Significant is defined as any
             disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject
             at risk through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis
             if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study.

          -  Unstable liver disease: ALT >2 times upper limit of normal (ULN); and bilirubin >1.5
             times ULN (isolated bilirubin >1.5 times ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is
             fractionated and direct bilirubin <35 percent). Current active liver or biliary
             disease (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones or
             otherwise stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment). Notes: Stable
             chronic liver disease should generally be defined by the absence of ascites,
             encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminaemia, oesophageal or gastric varices, or
             persistent jaundice, or cirrhosis; Chronic stable hepatitis B and C (e.g., presence of
             hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or positive hepatitis C antibody test result at
             screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment) are acceptable if
             subject otherwise meets entry criteria.

          -  Unstable or life threatening cardiac disease: subjects with any of the following at
             Screening (Visit 1) would be excluded: Myocardial infarction or unstable angina in the
             last 6 months; Unstable or life threatening cardiac arrhythmia requiring intervention
             in the last 3 months; New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class 4 Heart failure.

          -  Abnormal and clinically significant 12-Lead ECG finding: Investigators will be
             provided with ECG reviews conducted by a centralized independent cardiologist to
             assist in evaluation of subject eligibility. The investigator will determine the
             clinical significance of each abnormal ECG finding in relation to the subject's
             medical history and exclude subjects who would be at undue risk by participating in
             the trial. An abnormal and clinically significant finding that would preclude a
             subject from entering the trial is defined as a 12-lead tracing that is interpreted
             as, but not limited to, any of the following: atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid
             ventricular rate >120 beats per minute (BPM); sustained or nonsustained ventricular
             tachycardia (VT); Second degree heart block Mobitz type II and third degree heart
             block (unless pacemaker or defibrillator had been inserted).

             anticholinergic/muscarinic receptor antagonist, beta2-agonist, lactose/milk protein or
             magnesium stearate or a medical condition such as narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic
             hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction that, in the opinion of the investigator
             contraindicates study participation.

          -  Cancer: Subjects with carcinoma that has not been in complete remission for at least 3
             years. Subjects who have had carcinoma in situ of the cervix, squamous cell carcinoma
             and basal cell carcinoma of the skin would not be excluded based on the 3 year waiting
             period if the subject has been considered cured by treatment.

          -  Oxygen therapy: Use of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) described as resting oxygen
             therapy >3 Liters per minute (Oxygen use <= 3 Liters/minute flow is not exclusionary.)

          -  Medication prior to spirometry: Subjects who are medically unable to withhold their
             albuterol/salbutamol for the 4-hour period required prior to spirometry testing at
             each study visit.

             COPD is a preventable and treatable disease state characterized by airflow limitation
             that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually progressive and is
             associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or
             gases, primarily caused by cigarette smoking. Although COPD affects the lungs, it also
             produces significant systemic consequences.

          -  Tobacco Use and Smoking History: Current or former cigarette smokers with a history of
             cigarette smoking of >= 10 pack-years [Number of pack years = (number of cigarettes
             per day /20) x number of years smoked (e.g. 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years, or 10
             cigarettes per day for 20 years both equal 10 pack years)]. Former smokers are defined
             as those who have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1. Note: Pipe
             and/or cigar use cannot be used to calculate pack-year history. COPD patients who only
             use a pipe and/or cigar are not eligible.

             infections (such as tuberculosis) and lung cancer are absolute exclusionary
             conditions. A subject, who in the opinion of the investigator has any other
             significant respiratory conditions in addition to COPD should be excluded. Examples
             may include clinically significant bronchiectasis, pulmonary hypertension, sarcoidosis
             or interstitial lung disease.

          -  Other Diseases/Abnormalities: Subjects with historical or current evidence of
             clinically significant cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric, renal, hepatic,
             immunological, endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or
             haematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled and/or a previous history of cancer
             in remission for <5 years prior to Visit 1 (localized carcinoma of the skin that has
             been resected for cure is not exclusionary). Significant is defined as any disease
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk
             through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the
             disease/condition exacerbated during the study.

          -  Chest X-Ray: A chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan that reveals evidence of
             clinically significant abnormalities not believed to be due to the presence of COPD. A
             chest X-ray must be taken at Visit 1 if a chest X-ray or CT scan is not available
             within 6 months prior to Visit 1.

             anticholinergic/muscarinic receptor antagonist, beta2-agonist, lactose/milk protein or
             magnesium stearate or a medical condition such as of narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic
             hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction that, in the opinion of the study physician
             contraindicates study participation or use of an inhaled anticholinergic.

          -  12-Lead electrocardiogram (ECG): An abnormal and significant ECG finding from the
             12-lead ECG conducted at Visit 1, including the presence of a paced rhythm on a
             12-lead ECG which causes the underlying rhythm and ECG to be obscured. Investigators
             will be provided with ECG reviews conducted by a centralized independent cardiologist
             to assist in evaluation of subject eligibility. Specific ECG findings that precluded
             subject eligibility are as listed. An ECG finding that would preclude a subject from
             entering the trial is defined as a 12-lead tracing that is interpreted as, but not
             limited to, any of the following: Sinus tachycardia ≥120 bpm*Note: sinus tachycardia
             ≥120bpm should be confirmed by two additional readings at least 5 minutes apart. Sinus

             ≥450msec or an ECG that is unsuitable for QT measurements (e.g., poor defined
             termination of the T wave). For subjects with QRS duration>120: QTc(F) ≥480msec or an
             ECG that is unsuitable for QT measurements (e.g., poor defined termination of the T
             wave). Myocardial infarction (acute or recent) * Note: Evidence of an old (resolved)
             myocardial infarction is not exclusionary. The study investigator will determine the
             medical significance of any ECG abnormalities not listed above.

             For this definition, ""documented"" refers to the outcome of the
             investigator's/designee's medical examination of the subject or review of the
             subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview
             with the subject or from the subject's medical records.; Double barrier method: condom
             and an occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with a vaginal spermicidal

          -  COPD Diagnosis: An established clinical history of COPD in accordance with the
             definition by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society.

          -  Smoking History: Current or former cigarette smokers with a history of cigarette
             smoking of >10 pack-years at Screening (Visit 1) [number of pack years = (number of
             cigarettes per day / 20) x number of years smoked (e.g., 20 cigarettes per day for 10
             years, or 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years)]. Previous smokers are defined as those
             who have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1. Note: Pipe and/or
             cigar use cannot be used to calculate pack-year history.

             will be calculated using the European Respiratory Society Global Lung Function
             Initiative reference equations. Note: A documented history of a COPD exacerbation
             (e.g., medical record verification) is a medical record of worsening COPD symptoms
             that required systemic/oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics (for a moderate
             exacerbation) or hospitalization (for a severe exacerbation). Prior use of antibiotics
             alone does not qualify as an exacerbation history unless the use was associated with
             treatment of worsening symptoms of COPD, such as increased dyspnoea, sputum volume, or
             sputum purulence (colour). Subject verbal reports are not acceptable.

          -  Existing COPD maintenance treatment: Subject must be receiving daily maintenance
             treatment for their COPD for at least 3 months prior to Screening. Note: Subjects

          -  Lung resection: Subjects with lung volume reduction surgery within the 12 months prior
             to Screening.

          -  Risk Factors for Pneumonia: immune suppression (e.g. Human immunodeficiency virus
             [HIV], Lupus) or other risk factors for pneumonia (e.g. neurological disorders
             affecting control of the upper airway, such as Parkinson's Disease, Myasthenia
             Gravis). Subjects at potentially high risk (e.g. very low Body mass index [BMI],

             experiences pneumonia and/or moderate or severe COPD exacerbation during the run-in
             period will be excluded.

          -  Respiratory tract infection that has not resolved at least 7 days prior to Screening.

          -  Abnormal Chest X-ray (CXR): Chest X-ray (posteroanterior and lateral) reveals evidence
             of pneumonia or a clinically significant abnormality not believed to be due to the
             presence of COPD, or another condition that would hinder the ability to detect an
             infiltrate on CXR (e.g. significant cardiomegaly, pleural effusion or scarring). All
             subjects will have a CXR at Screening Visit 1) (or historical radiograph or Computed
             Tomography [CT] scan obtained within 3 months prior to screening) that will be
             over-read by a central vendor. Note: Subjects who have experienced pneumonia and/or
             moderate or severe COPD exacerbation within 3 months of screening must provide a post
             pneumonia/exacerbation CXR to be over-read by the central vendor or have a CXR
             conducted at Screening. For sites in Germany: If a chest x-ray (or CT scan) within 3
             months prior to Screening (Visit 1) is not available, approval to conduct a diagnostic
             CXR will need to be obtained from the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS).

          -  Other diseases/abnormalities: Subjects with historical or current evidence of
             clinically significant cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric, renal, hepatic,
             immunological, gastrointestinal, urogenital, nervous system, musculoskeletal, skin,
             sensory, endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or
             haematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled. Significant is defined as any
             disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would put the safety of the subject
             at risk through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis
             if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study. For subjects taking part in the
             physical activity monitor subset: Orthopaedic, neurological or other complaints that
             significantly impair normal biomechanical movement patterns and limit the ability to
             walk/cycle, as judged by the Investigator.

          -  Unstable liver disease as defined by the presence of ascites, encephalopathy,
             coagulopathy, hypoalbuminaemia, esophageal or gastric varices or persistent jaundice,
             cirrhosis, known biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or

             in the last 3 months; New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV Heart failure

          -  Abnormal and clinically significant 12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) finding:
             Investigators will be provided with ECG reviews conducted by a centralized independent
             cardiologist to assist in evaluation of subject eligibility. The Principal
             Investigator (PI) will determine the clinical significance of each abnormal ECG
             finding in relation to the subject's medical history and exclude subjects who would be
             at undue risk by participating in the trial. An abnormal and clinically significant
             finding that would preclude a subject from entering the trial is defined as a 12-lead
             tracing that is interpreted as, but not limited to, any of the following: Atrial
             fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate >120 Beats Per Minute (BPM); sustained
             or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT); Second degree heart block Mobitz type
             II and third degree heart block (unless pacemaker or defibrillator had been inserted);
             QT interval corrected for heart rate by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) >=500 milliseconds
             (msec) in subjects with QRS <120 msec and QTcF >=530 msec in subjects with QRS >=120

             hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             contraindicates study participation.

          -  Cancer: Subjects with carcinoma that has not been in complete remission for at least 5
             years. Subjects who have had carcinoma in situ of the cervix, squamous cell carcinoma
             and basal cell carcinoma of the skin would not be excluded based on the 5 year waiting
             period if the subject has been considered cured by treatment.

          -  Oxygen therapy: Use of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) described as resting oxygen
             therapy >3litres/minute (L/min) (Oxygen use <=3L/min flow is not exclusionary.)

             Subjects who are in the maintenance phase of a Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program are
             not excluded.

          -  Drug/alcohol abuse: Subjects with a known or suspected history of alcohol or drug
             abuse within the last 2 years.

          -  Non-compliance: Subjects at risk of non-compliance, or unable to comply with the study
             procedures. Any infirmity, disability, or geographic location that would limit
             compliance for scheduled visits.

          -  Questionable validity of consent: Subjects with a history of psychiatric disease,
             intellectual deficiency, poor motivation or other conditions that will limit the
             validity of informed consent to participate in the study.

          -  Affiliation with investigator site: study investigators, sub-investigators, study
             coordinators, employees of a participating investigator or study site, or immediate
             family members of the aforementioned that is involved with this study.

          -  Inability to read: In the opinion of the investigator, any subject who is unable to
             read and/or would not be able to complete study related materials.

          -  Medication prior to screening: No use of the following medications within the
             following time intervals prior to Screening or during the study. Long term antibiotic

          -  If the subject does not meet the above reversibility criteria at Visit 1 then the
             reversibility assessment may be repeated once within 7 days of Visit 1 if either
             criteria a) or b) are met: a) >=9% increase in FEV1 between 20 and 60 minutes

        profile (e.g., age appropriate, >45 years, in the absence of hormone replacement therapy).
        In questionable cases for women <60 years of age, a blood sample with simultaneous follicle
        stimulating hormone and estradiol falling into the central laboratory's postmenopausal
        reference range is confirmatory. Females under 60 years of age, who are on hormone
        replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt, are required to use a
        highly effective method to avoid pregnancy if they wish to continue their HRT during the
        study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status
        prior to study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks will elapse between
        the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage
        of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, subjects can resume use of
        HRT during the study without use of a highly effective method to avoid pregnancy;

             exacerbation in the 6 weeks prior to Visit 1 are not explicitly excluded at Visit 1
             provided that, at the Investigator's discretion, the subject's condition is stable
             after they have resumed their pre-exacerbation maintenance asthma therapy (without

          2. The patient continued to have a predose/pre-albuterol FEV1 at the randomization visit
             (RV) that was ≥40% of predicted normal.

          3. The patient had no clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results or ECG
             findings at the screening visit.

          4. The patient had no significant changes in asthma medications during run-in, excluding
             the albuterol/salbutamol HFA (90 mcg ex actuator) or equivalent used as rescue
             medication as supplied per protocol.
