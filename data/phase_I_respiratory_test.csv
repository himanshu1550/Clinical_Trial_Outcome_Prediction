          -  Patients who are not willing to apply highly effective contraception during the study
             and through the duration as defined below after the final dose of study treatment

             becoming pregnant. Must use highly effective contraception during the study and
             through 20 months after the final dose of study treatment. Highly effective
             contraception is defined as either:

               1. Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception

               2. Sterilization: Patient has had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman had
                  been confirmed by follow- up hormone level assessment

               3. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of
                  the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female study patients, the
                  vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient

               4. Use a combination of the following (both a + b):

                    1. Placement of a non-hormonal intrauterine device (IUD) or non- hormonal
                       intrauterine system (IUS)

                    2. Barrier method of contraception: Condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                       suppository.

                       Note: Hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, implanted) are
                       not allowed as it cannot be ruled out that the study drug decreases the
                       effectiveness of hormonal contraception.

                       Note: Women are considered post-menopausal and not child bearing potential
                       if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an
                       appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor
                       symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels >40
                       mIU/mL and estradiol <20 pg/mL or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy
                       (with or without hysterectomy) at least six week ago. In the case of
                       oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been
                       confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of
                       child bearing potential.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to paclitaxel

          -  Mental condition rendering the subject unable to understand the nature, scope, and

             inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/5 or drugs metabolized by CYP2B6 or CYP2C9 that have
             narrow therapeutic index, and that cannot be discontinued before starting treatment
             with sonidegib. Medications that are strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors should be discontinued
             at least 7 days and strong CYP3A/5 inducers for at least 2 weeks prior to starting
             treatment with sonidegib
