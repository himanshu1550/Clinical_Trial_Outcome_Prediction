          -  COPD Diagnosis: An established clinical history of COPD in accordance with the
             definition by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society.

          -  Smoking History: Current or former cigarette smokers with a history of cigarette
             smoking of >=10 pack-years at Screening (Visit 1) [number of pack years = (number of
             cigarettes per day divided by 20) x number of years smoked (e.g., 20 cigarettes per
             day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years)]. Previous smokers are
             defined as those who have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Screening
             (Visit 1). Note: Pipe and/or cigar use cannot be used to calculate pack-year history.

          -  Severity of COPD symptoms: A score of >=10 on the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) at
             Screening (Visit1).

          -  Severity of COPD Disease: A post-albuterol/salbutamol FEV1/FVC ratio of <0.70 at

             history of >=1 severe COPD exacerbation (hospitalised) in the 12 months prior to
             Screening (Visit 1). Notes: Percent predicted will be calculated using the European
             Respiratory Society Global Lung Function Initiative reference equations; A documented
             history of a COPD exacerbation (e.g., medical record verification) is a medical record
             of worsening COPD symptoms that required systemic/oral corticosteroids and/or
             antibiotics (for a moderate exacerbation) or hospitalisation (for a severe
             exacerbation). Prior use of antibiotics alone does not qualify as an exacerbation
             history unless the use was associated with treatment of worsening symptoms of COPD,
             such as increased dyspnoea, sputum volume, or sputum purulence (colour). Subject
             verbal reports are not acceptable.

             with other respiratory disorders (e.g. clinically significant: bronchiectasis,
             sarcoidosis, lung fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung diseases) are
             excluded if these conditions are the primary cause of their respiratory symptoms.

             as endobronchial valves) within the 12 months prior to Screening (Visit 1).

          -  Risk Factors for Pneumonia: immune suppression (e.g. advanced human immune deficiency
             virus (HIV) with high viral load and low cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count,
             Lupus on immunosuppressants that would increase risk of pneumonia) or other risk
             factors for pneumonia (e.g. neurological disorders affecting control of the upper
             airway, such as Parkinson's Disease, Myasthenia Gravis). Notes: Subjects at a high
             risk for pneumonia (e.g. very low body mass index (BMI), severely malnourished or very
             low FEV1) will only be included at the discretion of the investigator.

          -  Pneumonia and/or moderate or severe COPD exacerbation that has not resolved at least
             14 days prior to Screening (Visit 1) and at least 30 days following the last dose of

             significant abnormality not believed to be due to the presence of COPD, or another
             condition that would hinder the ability to detect an infiltrate on chest x-ray (e.g.
             significant cardiomegaly, pleural effusion or scarring). All subjects will have a
             chest x-ray at Screening (Visit 1) [or historical radiograph or computerised
             tomography (CT) scan obtained within 3 months prior to Screening (Visit 1). Notes:
             Subjects who have experienced pneumonia and/or moderate or severe COPD exacerbation
             within 3 months of Screening (Visit 1) must provide a post pneumonia/exacerbation
             chest x-ray or have a chest x-ray conducted at Screening (Visit 1); For sites in
             Germany: If a chest x-ray (or CT scan) within 3 months prior to Screening (Visit 1) is
             not available, approval to conduct a diagnostic chest x-ray will need to be obtained
             from the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BFS).

          -  Other diseases/abnormalities: Subjects with historical or current evidence of
             clinically significant cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric, renal, hepatic,
             immunological, gastrointestinal, urogenital, nervous system, musculoskeletal, skin,
             sensory, endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or
             hematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled. Significant is defined as any
             disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject
             at risk through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis
             if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study.

          -  Unstable liver disease: ALT >2 times upper limit of normal (ULN); and bilirubin >1.5
             times ULN (isolated bilirubin >1.5 times ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is
             fractionated and direct bilirubin <35 percent). Current active liver or biliary
             disease (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones or
             otherwise stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment). Notes: Stable
             chronic liver disease should generally be defined by the absence of ascites,
             encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminaemia, oesophageal or gastric varices, or
             persistent jaundice, or cirrhosis; Chronic stable hepatitis B and C (e.g., presence of
             hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or positive hepatitis C antibody test result at
             screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment) are acceptable if
             subject otherwise meets entry criteria.

          -  Unstable or life threatening cardiac disease: subjects with any of the following at
             Screening (Visit 1) would be excluded: Myocardial infarction or unstable angina in the
             last 6 months; Unstable or life threatening cardiac arrhythmia requiring intervention
             in the last 3 months; New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class 4 Heart failure.

          -  Abnormal and clinically significant 12-Lead ECG finding: Investigators will be
             provided with ECG reviews conducted by a centralized independent cardiologist to
             assist in evaluation of subject eligibility. The investigator will determine the
             clinical significance of each abnormal ECG finding in relation to the subject's
             medical history and exclude subjects who would be at undue risk by participating in
             the trial. An abnormal and clinically significant finding that would preclude a
             subject from entering the trial is defined as a 12-lead tracing that is interpreted
             as, but not limited to, any of the following: atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid
             ventricular rate >120 beats per minute (BPM); sustained or nonsustained ventricular
             tachycardia (VT); Second degree heart block Mobitz type II and third degree heart
             block (unless pacemaker or defibrillator had been inserted).

             anticholinergic/muscarinic receptor antagonist, beta2-agonist, lactose/milk protein or
             magnesium stearate or a medical condition such as narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic
             hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction that, in the opinion of the investigator
             contraindicates study participation.

          -  Cancer: Subjects with carcinoma that has not been in complete remission for at least 3
             years. Subjects who have had carcinoma in situ of the cervix, squamous cell carcinoma
             and basal cell carcinoma of the skin would not be excluded based on the 3 year waiting
             period if the subject has been considered cured by treatment.

          -  Oxygen therapy: Use of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) described as resting oxygen
             therapy >3 Liters per minute (Oxygen use <= 3 Liters/minute flow is not exclusionary.)

             have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1. Pipe and/or cigar use
             cannot be used to calculate pack-year history.

          -  Male and female subjects are eligible to participate in the study. A female subject is
             eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative urine human
             chorionic gonadotrophin test), not lactating, and at least one of the following
             conditions applies: non-reproductive potential defined as pre-menopausal females with

             follow-up confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion or hysterectomy or documented
             bilateral oophorectomy. Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea.
             In questionable cases, a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone
             and estradiol levels consistent with menopause must be tested. Females on hormone
             replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to
             use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their
             HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
             post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment.

        A female subject with reproductive potential is eligible to participate if she is not
        pregnant and agrees to follow one of the highly effective methods for avoiding pregnancy in
        females of reproductive potential from 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication
        and until (at least five terminal half-lives or until any continuing pharmacologic effect
        has ended, whichever is longer) after the last dose of study medication and completion of

             with the following abnormalities are excluded from participation in the study: atrial
             fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate >120 beats per minute (bpm), sustained or
             non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, second degree heart block Mobitz type II or
             third degree heart block (unless pacemaker or defibrillator had been inserted).

          -  Subjects with medical conditions such as narrow-angle glaucoma, urinary retention,
             prostatic hypertrophy, or bladder neck obstruction will be excluded unless, in the
             opinion of the study physician, the benefit outweighs the risk.

          -  Any subject who is considered unlikely to survive the duration of the study period or
             has any rapidly progressing disease or immediate life-threatening illness (e.g.,
             cancer). In addition, any subject who has any other condition (e.g., neurological
             condition) that is likely to affect respiratory function will not be included in the
             study.

             are to be taken on the day before Visit 1. According to investigators judgement,
             patients should be able to withhold LABA therapy during the run-in and wash-out
             period.

             that would, in the opinion of investigator, compromise subject safety, or
             significantly affect subject's ability to complete the trial. As such, the
             investigator will determine the clinical significance of any ECG abnormality and
             determine if a subject is precluded from entering the study. At Visit 1 (Screening and
             Run-in Visit), ECG safety criteria must be: QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc)
             <450 microseconds (msec) or QTc <480 msec for patients with bundle branch block. The
             QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to either Bazett's formula
             (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF), or another method, machine or manual overread.
             The QTc should be based on single or averaged QTc values of triplicate ECGs obtained
             over a brief recording period. Investigators will be responsible for ensuring
             appropriate clinical interpretation of ECGs.

             COPD is a preventable and treatable disease state characterized by airflow limitation
             that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually progressive and is
             associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or
             gases, primarily caused by cigarette smoking. Although COPD affects the lungs, it also
             produces significant systemic consequences.

          -  Tobacco Use and Smoking History: Current or former cigarette smokers with a history of
             cigarette smoking of >= 10 pack-years [Number of pack years = (number of cigarettes
             per day /20) x number of years smoked (e.g. 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years, or 10
             cigarettes per day for 20 years both equal 10 pack years)]. Former smokers are defined
             as those who have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1. Note: Pipe
             and/or cigar use cannot be used to calculate pack-year history. COPD patients who only

             infections (such as tuberculosis) and lung cancer are absolute exclusionary
             conditions. A subject, who in the opinion of the investigator has any other
             significant respiratory conditions in addition to COPD should be excluded. Examples
             may include clinically significant bronchiectasis, pulmonary hypertension, sarcoidosis
             or interstitial lung disease.

          -  Other Diseases/Abnormalities: Subjects with historical or current evidence of

             in remission for <5 years prior to Visit 1 (localized carcinoma of the skin that has
             been resected for cure is not exclusionary). Significant is defined as any disease
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk
             through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the
             disease/condition exacerbated during the study.

          -  Chest X-Ray: A chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan that reveals evidence of

             12-lead ECG conducted at Visit 1, including the presence of a paced rhythm on a
             12-lead ECG which causes the underlying rhythm and ECG to be obscured. Investigators
             will be provided with ECG reviews conducted by a centralized independent cardiologist
             to assist in evaluation of subject eligibility. Specific ECG findings that precluded
             subject eligibility are as listed. An ECG finding that would preclude a subject from
             entering the trial is defined as a 12-lead tracing that is interpreted as, but not
             limited to, any of the following: Sinus tachycardia ≥120 bpm*Note: sinus tachycardia

             ECG that is unsuitable for QT measurements (e.g., poor defined termination of the T
             wave). Myocardial infarction (acute or recent) * Note: Evidence of an old (resolved)
             myocardial infarction is not exclusionary. The study investigator will determine the

             pneumonia/exacerbation CXR to be over-read by the central vendor or have a CXR
             conducted at Screening. For sites in Germany: If a chest x-ray (or CT scan) within 3
             months prior to Screening (Visit 1) is not available, approval to conduct a diagnostic
             CXR will need to be obtained from the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS).

          -  Other diseases/abnormalities: Subjects with historical or current evidence of

             sensory, endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or
             haematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled. Significant is defined as any
             disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would put the safety of the subject
             at risk through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis
             if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study. For subjects taking part in the
             physical activity monitor subset: Orthopaedic, neurological or other complaints that
             significantly impair normal biomechanical movement patterns and limit the ability to
             walk/cycle, as judged by the Investigator.

          -  Unstable liver disease as defined by the presence of ascites, encephalopathy,
             coagulopathy, hypoalbuminaemia, esophageal or gastric varices or persistent jaundice,

             Investigators will be provided with ECG reviews conducted by a centralized independent
             cardiologist to assist in evaluation of subject eligibility. The Principal
             Investigator (PI) will determine the clinical significance of each abnormal ECG
             finding in relation to the subject's medical history and exclude subjects who would be
             at undue risk by participating in the trial. An abnormal and clinically significant
             finding that would preclude a subject from entering the trial is defined as a 12-lead
             tracing that is interpreted as, but not limited to, any of the following: Atrial
             fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate >120 Beats Per Minute (BPM); sustained
             or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT); Second degree heart block Mobitz type
             II and third degree heart block (unless pacemaker or defibrillator had been inserted);

             of the predicted normal value at Visit 1. Predicted values will be based upon the
             European Respiratory Society (ERS) Global Lung Function Initiative.

          -  Reversibility of Disease: airway reversibility defined as >=12% and >=200 milliliter
             (mL) increase in FEV1 between 20 and 60 minutes following 4 inhalations of

          -  If the subject does not meet the above reversibility criteria at Visit 1 then the
             reversibility assessment may be repeated once within 7 days of Visit 1 if either
             criteria a) or b) are met: a) >=9% increase in FEV1 between 20 and 60 minutes

        period.

          -  Short-Acting beta2 Agonists (SABAs): All subjects must be able to replace their
             current SABA inhaler with albuterol/salbutamol aerosol inhaler at Visit 1 as needed
             for the duration of the study. Subjects must be judged capable of withholding
             albuterol/salbutamol for at least 6 hours prior to study visits.

          -  Male or eligible Female, defined as having documentation of non-reproductive potential
             or reproductive potential as follows:

        A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a
        negative serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) test), not lactating, is not planning on
        becoming pregnant during the study and at least one of the following conditions applies:
        Non-reproductive potential defined as pre-menopausal females with documented tubal ligation
        or documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with follow-up confirmation of
        bilateral tubal occlusion or hysterectomy or documented bilateral oophorectomy;
        Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical
        profile (e.g., age appropriate, >45 years, in the absence of hormone replacement therapy).
        In questionable cases for women <60 years of age, a blood sample with simultaneous follicle
        stimulating hormone and estradiol falling into the central laboratory's postmenopausal
        reference range is confirmatory. Females under 60 years of age, who are on hormone
        replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt, are required to use a
        highly effective method to avoid pregnancy if they wish to continue their HRT during the
        study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status
        prior to study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks will elapse between
        the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage
        of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, subjects can resume use of
        HRT during the study without use of a highly effective method to avoid pregnancy;
        Reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of the options listed in the Modified List
        of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of Reproductive Potential

             exacerbation in the 6 weeks prior to Visit 1 are not explicitly excluded at Visit 1
             provided that, at the Investigator's discretion, the subject's condition is stable
             after they have resumed their pre-exacerbation maintenance asthma therapy (without

             in the last 3 months; New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV Heart failure.

          -  Antimuscarinic effects: Subjects with a medical condition such as narrow-angle
             glaucoma, urinary retention, prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction should
             only be included if in the opinion of the Investigator the benefit outweighs the risk
             and that the condition would not contraindicate study participation.

          -  Cancer: Subjects with carcinoma that has not been in complete remission for at least 5
             years. Subjects who have had carcinoma in situ of the cervix, squamous cell carcinoma

        Criteria for Randomization:

        Patients were randomized into the study if they met all of the following criteria:

          1. The patient continued to be in general good health, meeting the entry criteria.

          2. The patient continued to have a predose/pre-albuterol FEV1 at the randomization visit
             (RV) that was ≥40% of predicted normal.

          3. The patient had no clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results or ECG
             findings at the screening visit.

          4. The patient had no significant changes in asthma medications during run-in, excluding
             the albuterol/salbutamol HFA (90 mcg ex actuator) or equivalent used as rescue
             medication as supplied per protocol.

          5. The patient did not have a upper respiratory tract infection (URI) or lower
             respiratory tract infection (LRI) during the run in period. Patients who developed a
             URI or LRI during the run in period could be discontinued from the study and allowed
             to re-screen 2 weeks after resolution of symptoms.

          6. The patient had no asthma exacerbation during the run in period, defined as any
             worsening of asthma requiring any significant treatment other than rescue
             albuterol/salbutamol HFA (90 mcg ex actuator) or equivalent or the patient's run-in
             MDPI. This included requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids and/or emergency
             department (ED) visit or hospitalization or an increase in the patient's regularly
             prescribed nonsteroidal maintenance treatment. Urgent care/ED visits where the
             treatment was limited to a single dose of nebulized albuterol/salbutamol did not meet
             the criteria of an asthma exacerbation.

             oropharyngeal candidiasis.

          8. The patient did not experience an adverse event that would result in failure to
             continue to meet selection criteria.

          9. The patient did not use any of the prohibited concomitant medications during the run
             in period.

         10. The patient complied with completion of the daily diary, defined as follows:

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with active brain metastases are not eligible as lethal intratumoral
             hemorrhages have been reported with erlotinib therapy. Patients with brain metastases
             that have been treated and stable for > 30 days following treatment will be eligible.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or breast feeding will not be entered into the study as
             erlotinib is teratogenic. Pregnancy tests must be obtained in females who are
             post-menarchal. Post-menarchal females with HCG secreting tumors will be excluded as
             pregnancy can't be excluded. Males or females of reproductive potential may not
             participate unless they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method for the
             duration of the study.

          -  Concomitant medications

               -  Investigational Drugs: Patients who are currently receiving another
                  investigational drug are not eligible.

               -  Anti-cancer Agents: Patients who are currently receiving other anti-cancer agents
                  are not eligible.

               -  Anticonvulsants: Patients who are receiving enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants are
                  not eligible (see Appendix 1 for a list of enzyme- inducing anticonvulsants).

               -  Anticoagulants: Use of warfarin is not allowed while on study. Patients already
                  on warfarin should use alternative anticoagulants while on this study. Warfarin
                  must not have been administered within 7 days of enrollment.

               -  Smoking: Smoking induces CYP3A4/5 enzymes and decreases exposure to sirolimus and
                  erlotinib. Thus, patients must not smoke for 10 days prior to enrollment and for
                  the duration of therapy.

          -  Infection: Patients who have an uncontrolled infection are not eligible.

          -  Drug interactions: Sirolimus and erlotinib are primarily metabolized by the CYP3A4/5
             enzymes. Drug exposure is substantially effected by CYP inhibitors (increased
             exposure) and inducers (decreased exposure). Thus, concomitant administration of
             strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors or inducers is prohibited while on therapy. See Appendix 1
             for a list of these medications. Patients must not have received these medications for
             a minimum of 10 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients who have received prior therapy targeting EGFR with small molecule tyrosine
             kinase inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies are NOT eligible.

          -  Prior treatment with mTOR or TORC1/2 inhibitors (eg, rapamycin, temsirolimus,
             everolimus, sirolimus) is NOT allowed.

          -  Patients who have had major surgery within 3 weeks prior to enrollment are not
             eligible. Procedures such as placement of a central vascular catheter, or limited
             tumor biopsy, are not considered major surgery.

          -  Patients who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with the
             safety monitoring requirements of the study are not eligible.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have an established and confirmed diagnosis of AML by World Health
             Organization (WHO) criteria, excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).

          -  Patients must have relapsed or refractory AML, defined as:

               -  Relapsed: >= 5% bone marrow blasts by morphology, reappearance of minimal
                  residual disease (MRD) (> 0.1%) by flow cytometry, reappearance of peripheral
                  blood blasts, or development of extramedullary leukemia after one or more prior
                  lines of therapy. Consolidation regimens, including autologous and allogeneic
                  HCT, do not count as a separate prior line of therapy, (e.g., 7+3 followed by
                  cytarabine consolidation followed by allogeneic hematopoietic cell
                  transplantation (HCT) would be considered one prior line of therapy). Note, there
                  is no restriction on the prior number of relapses and prior treatment of relapsed
                  disease is allowed.

               -  Refractory: no complete response (CR) or complete response with incomplete bone
                  marrow recovery (CRi) after two courses of induction therapy (e.g. therapy with
                  the intent to induce remission). Patients 75 years or older, or patients of any
                  age with comorbidities that prevent the use of further intensive chemotherapy,
                  will be eligible if they did not experience CR or CRi after one course of
                  induction therapy.

          -  Patients must have Karnofsky >= 60%.

          -  Patients must have a white blood cell count (WBC) =< 25 x 10^9 cells/L. Hydroxyurea
             and leukapheresis are permitted to satisfy this criterion.

          -  Total bilirubin =< institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) except in patients with
             Gilbert's syndrome or post-transfusion hemolysis. Patients with Gilbert's syndrome or
             post-transfusion hemolysis may enroll if direct bilirubin =< 1.5 x ULN of the direct
             bilirubin.

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT])
             =< 3 x institutional ULN (unless resulting from liver infiltration with leukemia).

          -  Creatinine clearance >= 30 mL/min (If serum creatinine not =< institutional ULN).

          -  Hemoglobin > 8 g/dL. Patients may be transfused to achieve this value.

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients will be eligible for this trial
             if they are on effective antiretroviral regimens utilizing non-CYP-interacting agents,
             they have an undetectable viral load, they have a CD4 count > 350 cells/mm^3, and they
             have no history of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining opportunistic
             infections. If there is evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, HBV
             viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated. If there is
             history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the patient must have been treated and
             have undetectable HCV viral load.

          -  Patients must be willing to submit blood samples for the integrated biomarker.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential (i.e. who are not postmenopausal for at
             least 1 year before screening or are not surgically sterile) must have a negative
             serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to the first study drug administration and
             must agree to practice one highly effective method and one additional effective
             (barrier) method of contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the
             informed consent through 4 months after the last dose of study drug, or agree to
             practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle
             of the patient. Male patients, even if surgically sterilized, must agree to practice
             effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period through 4
             months after the last dose of study drug, or agree to practice true abstinence when
             this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic
             abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods),
             withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of
             contraception.

          -  Patients may have had prior allogeneic HCT at least 3 months prior to randomization
             but should not have evidence of active graft versus host disease or require systemic
             immune suppression.

          -  Patients must be able to understand and be willing to sign a written informed consent
             document.

          -  Patients with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) will be eligible if they have a
             legal guardian or a close family member available to assist them.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must not have had prior treatment with MLN4924 (pevonedistat), azacitidine,
             or decitabine.

          -  Patients for whom, in the opinion of the treating physician, azacitidine alone is not
             an appropriate treatment will be excluded.

          -  Patients must not have documented active central nervous system (CNS) involvement by
             leukemia. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical
             trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive
             neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other
             adverse events.

          -  Patients must not have received any other investigational or commercial agents or
             therapies administered with the intention to treat their leukemia within 14 days or
             five half-lives (whichever is shorter) of first receipt of study drug, with the
             exception of hydroxyurea used to control WBCs.

          -  All non-hematologic adverse events (AEs) of prior chemotherapy, surgery, or
             radiotherapy, except alopecia, must have resolved to National Cancer Institute (NCI)
             Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade =< 2 prior to starting
             therapy.

          -  Patients must not have a history of other malignancies, except:

               -  Any malignancy that was treated with curative intent, has no known active disease
                  present for >= 1 year before the first dose of study drug, and is felt to be at
                  low risk of recurrence by the treating physician;

               -  Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence
                  of disease;

               -  Adequately treated carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease;

               -  Low-risk prostate cancer after curative surgery.

          -  Patients must not have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of
             similar chemical or biologic composition to MLN4924 (pevonedistat), azacitidine, or
             mannitol.

          -  Clinically significant metabolic enzyme inducers are not permitted during this study,
             or within 14 days before the first dose of study drugs. As part of the
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal
             product.

          -  Patients must not have severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other
             conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, could affect their participation
             in the study.

          -  Pregnant women are ineligible because, as an Nedd8 activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor,
             MLN4924 (pevonedistat) has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with MLN4924 (pevonedistat), breastfeeding must be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with MLN4924 (pevonedistat). These potential
             risks may also apply to azacitidine.

          -  Patients must not have had major surgery within 14 days before the first dose of any
             study drug or be scheduled for surgery during the study period.

          -  Patients must not have uncontrolled coagulopathy or a bleeding disorder unless
             directly attributable to their AML (e.g., disseminated intravascular coagulation).

          -  Patients must not have known hepatic cirrhosis or severe pre-existing hepatic
             impairment.

          -  Patients must not have known cardiopulmonary disease defined as:

                  revascularization more than 6 months before screening and who are without cardiac
                  symptoms or those with a prior non-ST elevation MI due to demand-supply mismatch
                  (NSTEM type II) may enroll;

               -  Symptomatic cardiomyopathy;

               -  Clinically significant arrhythmia:

                    -  History of polymorphic ventricular fibrillation or torsade de pointes,

                    -  Permanent atrial fibrillation, defined as continuous atrial fibrillation
                       lasting for >= 6 months;

                    -  Persistent atrial fibrillation, defined as sustained atrial fibrillation
                       lasting > 7 days and/or requiring cardioversion in the 4 weeks before
                       screening;

                    -  Grade 3 atrial fibrillation, defined as symptomatic and incompletely
                       controlled medically, or controlled with a device (e.g., pacemaker) or by
                       ablation;

                    -  Patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or < grade 3 atrial
                       fibrillation for period of at least 6 months are permitted to enroll
                       provided that their heart rate is controlled on a stable regimen;

               -  Moderate or severe pulmonary hypertension.

          -  Patients must not have uncontrolled high blood pressure that cannot be controlled by
             standard therapies.

          -  Patients must not have any life-threatening illness unrelated to cancer.

          -  Patients must not have an active, uncontrolled infection or severe infectious disease,
             (e.g. severe pneumonia, meningitis, or septicemia). Patients with an uncontrolled
             infection must not be enrolled until they have received treatment and the infection is
             under control.

          -  Patients must not have prolonged rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval >= 480 msec,
             calculated according to institutional guidelines.

          -  Patients must not have left ventricular ejection fraction < 40% as assessed by a
             transthoracic echocardiogram or radionuclide angiography within one month prior to
             study entry.

             interstitial lung disease, or pulmonary fibrosis.

          -  Female patients who intend to donate eggs (ova) during the course of this study or
             within 4 months of receiving their last dose of study drugs are ineligible.

          -  Male patients who intend to donate sperm during the course of this study or within 4

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has previously enrolled in a clinical study of CK-2127107.

          -  Subject has any clinically significant abnormality following the investigator's review
             of the physical examination, ECG and protocol-defined clinical laboratory tests at

             requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids (intramuscular, intravenous, or
             oral) in the 12 months prior to Visit 1 despite the use of high-dose ICS. For subjects
             receiving omalizumab for >=8 months, at least one exacerbation must have occurred
             while on omalizumab treatment. For subjects receiving maintenance oral
             corticosteroids, the corticosteroid treatment for the exacerbations must have been a

             consistent with menopause (refer to laboratory reference ranges for confirmatory
             levels)]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is
             in doubt will be required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if
             they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT
             to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment. b)
             Reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of the options listed in the Modified
             List of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of Reproductive
             Potential (FRP) from 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication and until at
             least five terminal half-lives or until any continuing pharmacologic effect has ended,
             whichever is longer, after the last dose of study medication and completion of the
             Exit visit/Early Withdrawal visit.The investigator is responsible for ensuring that

             Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones or otherwise stable chronic liver
             disease per investigator assessment). Stable chronic liver disease should generally be
             defined by the absence of ascites, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminaemia,
             oesophageal or gastric varices, or persistent jaundice, or cirrhosis.

          -  Subjects with QT interval corrected (QTc) > 450 milliseconds (msec) or QTc > 480 msec
             in subjects with Bundle Branch Block at screening Visit 1.The QTc is the QT interval
             corrected for heart rate according to Bazett's formula (QTcB), Fridericia's formula
             (QTcF), and/or another method, machine-read or manually over-read. The specific
             formula that will be used to determine eligibility and discontinuation for an
             individual subject should be determined prior to initiation of the study. In other
             words, several different formulae cannot be used to calculate the QTc for an
             individual subject and then the lowest QTc value used to include or discontinue the
             subject from the trial.For purposes of data analysis, QTcB, QTcF, another QT
             correction formula, or a composite of available values of QTc will be used.

          -  Other Concurrent Medical Conditions: Subjects who have known, pre-existing, clinically
             significant endocrine, autoimmune, metabolic, neurological, renal, gastrointestinal,
             hepatic, haematological or any other system abnormalities that are uncontrolled with
             standard treatment.

          -  Eosinophilic Diseases: Subjects with other conditions that could lead to elevated
             eosinophils such as Hypereosinophilic Syndromes, including Churg-Strauss Syndrome
             (Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis [EGPA]), or Eosinophilic Esophagitis.
             Subjects with a known, pre-existing parasitic infestation within 6 months prior to
             Visit 1 are also to be excluded.

          -  Immunodeficiency: A known immunodeficiency (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]),
             other than that explained by the use of corticosteroids taken as therapy for asthma.

          -  Other Monoclonal Antibodies: Subjects who have received any monoclonal antibody (other
             than omalizumab) to treat inflammatory disease within 5 half-lives of Visit 1.

          -  Smoking history: Current smokers or former smokers with a smoking history of >=10 pack
             years (number of pack years = (number of cigarettes per day / 20) x number of years
             smoked). A former smoker is defined as a subject who quit smoking at least 6 months
             prior to Screening Visit 1.

          -  Alcohol/Substance Abuse: A history (or suspected history) of alcohol misuse or
             substance abuse within 2 years prior to Visit 1.

          -  Hypersensitivity: Subjects with allergy/intolerance to a monoclonal antibody or
             biologic. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components
             thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator
             or Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Investigator opinion: Omalizumab treatment has provided significant clinical benefit
             despite experiencing 2 exacerbations in the past 12 months, and potential benefit from
             a switch to mepolizumab would not outweigh the potential harm after omalizumab
             withdrawal for the subject.

          -  Previous participation: Previously participated in any study with mepolizumab and
             received investigational product (including placebo).

          -  Investigational Medications: Subjects who have received treatment with an
             investigational drug within the past 30 days or five terminal phase half-lives of the
             drug whichever is longer, prior to Screening (V1) (this also includes investigational
             formulations of marketed products).

          -  Pregnancy: Subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Patients should not be enrolled
             if they plan to become pregnant during the time of study participation.
