        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants has Multiple Myeloma (MM) and:

             a. Has received prior ASCT after standard first-line induction treatment. b. Has
             evidence of progressive disease (PD), with progression-free interval greater than or
             equal to (>=) 6 months in Phase 1 >= 18 months in Phase 2.

          9. The effects of ONC201 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,
             women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform
             her treating physician immediately.

         10. Tumor specimen (paraffin-embedded block or frozen tissue) from prior resection or
             biopsy available that is sufficient to perform pharmacodynamic assays (>3 slides for
             IHC)

         11. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have received bevacizumab therapy.

          2. Patients with known brain metastases will be excluded from the phase I portion of the
             study. In the phase II portion, patients with known CNS metastases will be limited to
             20% of the patient population to accrue proportionately. Patients with CNS metastases
             must be stable after therapy for CNS metastases (such as surgery, radiotherapy or
             stereotactic radiosurgery) for > 3 month and must be off steroid treatment prior to

             composition to ONC201 or its excipients.

          4. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          5. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ONC201 is novel agent with unknown
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with ONC201, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with
             ONC201.

          6. Patients with a known HIV-positive test on combination antiretroviral therapy are
             ineligible for the initial first-in-man trial because of the potential for
             pharmacokinetic interactions with ONC201. In addition, these patients are at increased
             risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate
             studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy
             when indicated.

          7. Patients with known history of cardiac arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation,
             tachyarrhythmias or bradycardia will be excluded. Patients receiving therapeutic
             agents known to prolong QT interval will be excluded. Patients with history of CHF, or
             MI or stroke in the last 3 months will be excluded. Patients with a history of
             seizures will be excluded form the initial trial because ONC201 crosses the
             blood-brain barrier and this may affect their anti-seizure therapy.

          8. Active drug use or alcoholism.

             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because lenalidomide has
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with lenalidomide, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is
             treated with lenalidomide.

          -  Known sera-positive for or active viral infection with human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Patients who are

             who are considered post-menopausal and not of childbearing potential as defined below.

        Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child-bearing potential if they have had 12
        months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age
        appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy
        (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago.

             cervix are allowed. Participants with a malignancy that has been treated with curative
             intent will also be allowed if the malignancy has been in remission without treatment
             for ≥ 2 years prior to Cycle 1, Day 1.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the risks with B-701 are unknown
             and pembrolizumab is a PD-1 inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with B-701 and
             pembrolizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued. Women of child-bearing potential
             must agree to use adequate birth control throughout the study duration.

          -  Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV serology-positive (or known history of HIV
             seropositive status) participants are ineligible because these underlying diseases
             will confound interpretation of important safety assessments, e.g. liver function
             tests, increased potential for reactivation or exacerbation of viral infections. Such
             individuals may be taking or require other drugs, and may be at higher risk of
             opportunistic infections and adverse effects. Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV
             serology-positive individuals were excluded from the pivotal pembrolizumab clinical
             trial in melanoma, so safety of this drug in this setting is unknown.

          -  Known active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, parasitic, or other infection
             (excluding fungal infections of nail beds) at screening or any major episode of

             been stable on the same pill before taking study treatment. Note: Oral contraceptives
             are allowed but should be used in conjunction with a barrier method of contraception
             due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction. Women are considered post-menopausal
             and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous)

             pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic
             gonadotropin) or nursing.

          8. Female subjects of childbearing potential who were sexually active with a
             non-sterilized male partner must have used at least one highly effective method of
             contraception (see table below) from the time of screening and must have agreed to
             continue using such precautions for 90 days after the final dose of investigational
             products. Non-sterilized male partners of a female subject must have used male condoms
             plus spermicide throughout this period. Cessation of birth control after this point
             should have been discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual
             activity for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period was an
             acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the
             withdrawal method were not acceptable methods of birth control.

             Female subjects should have refrained from breastfeeding throughout the period
             described above.

             Females of childbearing potential were defined as those who were not surgically
             sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete
             hysterectomy) or post-menopausal.

             Females were considered post-menopausal if they had been amenorrheic for 12 months
             without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements applied:

               -  Females <50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal
                  treatments and if they had luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone
                  levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical
                  sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).

               -  Females ≥50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal
                  treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses >1 year prior to
                  study entry, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses >1 year prior to
                  study entry, or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy,
                  bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy).

             Non-sterilized male subjects who were sexually active with a female partner of
             childbearing potential must have used male condoms plus spermicide from screening
             through 90 days after receipt of the final dose of investigational products. Male
             subjects were to refrain from sperm donation throughout this period. Female partners
             (of childbearing potential) of a male subject must have used a highly effective method
             of contraception (see table below) throughout this period. Cessation of birth control
             after this point was to be discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in
             sexual activity for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period was an
             acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the
             withdrawal method were not acceptable methods of birth control.

             A highly effective method of contraception was defined as one that resulted in a low
             failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Note
             that some contraception methods were not considered highly effective (e.g. male or
             female condom with or without spermicide; female cap, diaphragm, or sponge with or
             without spermicide; non-copper containing intrauterine device; progestogen-only oral
             hormonal contraceptive pills where inhibition of ovulation was not the primary mode of
             action [excluding Cerazette/desogestrel which was considered highly effective]; and
             triphasic combined oral contraceptive pills).

          9. Subjects who were immunosuppressed, including those with known immunodeficiency.

         10. Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that included clinical
             history, physical examination and radiographic findings, and tuberculosis testing in
             line with local practice), hepatitis B (known positive hepatitis B virus surface
             antigen result), hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (positive 1/2
             antibodies). Subjects with a past or resolved hepatitis B virus infection (defined as
             the presence of hepatitis B core antibody and absence of hepatitis B virus surface
             antigen) were eligible. Subjects positive for hepatitis C antibody were eligible only
             if polymerase chain reaction was negative for hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid.

         11. History of severe allergic reactions to any unknown allergens or components of the
             study drugs.

         12. Other serious illnesses (e.g., serious infections requiring antibiotics, bleeding
             disorders).

         13. Mental impairment that may have compromised compliance with the requirements of the
             study.

         14. Lack of availability for immunological and clinical follow-up assessment.

         15. Inability to swallow or retain oral medication, presence of active gastrointestinal
             disease or other condition that would have interfered significantly with the
             absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of ensartinib.

         16. Any condition that, in the clinical judgment of the treating physician, was likely to
             prevent the subject from complying with any aspect of the protocol or that may have
             put the subject at unacceptable risk.

         17. History of allogeneic organ transplant.

         18. Subjects must not have donated blood while on study and for at least 90 days following
             the last durvalumab treatment.

             medications with a narrow therapeutic window that are substrates of CYP2C19, CYP2C9,
             and/or CYP3A. Selection of an alternate concomitant medication is recommended. Caution
             should also be exercised for concomitant use of certain statin drugs (e.g.
             rosuvastatin and fluvastatin) due to potential increase in exposure from inhibition of
             BCRP and CYP2C9. An updated list of clinically relevant P450 drug interactions (e.g:
             Flockhart Table http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/main-table/) should be
             reviewed while screening patients for study.

               -  Patients taking warfarin should have international normalized ration (INR)
                  monitored regularly according to standard institutional practices

               -  Because rucaparib is a moderate inhibitor of P-gp in vitro, caution should be
                  exercised for patients receiving rucaparib and requiring concomitant medication
                  with digoxin. Patients taking digoxin should have their digoxin levels monitored
                  after starting rucaparib and then regularly per standard clinical practice.

          -  Patients on parenteral nutrition are not eligible. Patients must not have a
             pre-existing duodenal stent or any gastrointestinal disorder or defect that would, in
             the opinion of the treating investigator, interfere with absorption of rucaparib.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, requirement for
             oxygen therapy, ongoing or active infection other than minor urinary tract infection,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          -  Known history of chronic hepatitis B or C as evidenced by:

               -  Positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen

                  reaction [PCR])

               -  Note: Subjects with positive hepatitis C antibody and negative quantitative
                  hepatitis C by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are eligible.

          -  Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             rucaparib. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.

          -  Prior organ allograft or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.

          -  Adverse effect of prior therapy not improved to Common Terminology Criteria for
             Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 1 or below with the exception of alopecia or lymphopenia.
             Ongoing Grade 2 non-hematologic toxicity (e.g. neuropathy) related to most recent
             treatment regimen may be permitted with prior advanced approval from the Lead
             Principal Investigator.

          -  Initiated denosumab or bisphosphonate therapy or adjusted denosumab or bisphosphonate
             dose/regimen within 4 weeks prior to first dose of rucaparib. Patients on a stable
             denosumab or bisphosphonate regimen are eligible and may continue treatment.

          -  Evidence or history of active or latent tuberculosis infection including purified
             protein derivative (PPD) recently converted to positive.

          -  Use of non-oncology vaccines containing live virus for prevention of infectious
             diseases within 12 weeks prior to study drug. The use of inactivated seasonal
             influenza vaccines, e.g., Fluzone®, will be permitted on study without restriction.

         17. Female subjects of childbearing potential who were sexually active with a
             nonsterilized male partner must have used at least one highly effective method of
             contraception from the time of screening, and must have agreed to continue using such
             precautions for 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab or for 6 months after the
             last dose of tremelimumab (whichever was longer). Non-sterilized male partners of a
             female subject must have used male condoms plus spermicide throughout this period.
             Cessation of birth control after this point should have been discussed with a
             responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the
             trial and the drug washout period was an acceptable practice; however, periodic
             abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method were not acceptable methods
             of birth control.

             Female subjects should have refrained from breastfeeding throughout the period
             described above.

             Females of childbearing potential were defined as those who were not surgically
             sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete
             hysterectomy) or postmenopausal.

             Females were considered post-menopausal if they had been amenorrheic for 12 months
             without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements applied:

               -  Females < 50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal
                  treatments and if they had luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone
                  levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical
                  sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).

               -  Females ≥ 50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal
                  treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, had
                  chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, or underwent
                  surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or
                  hysterectomy).

             Women of childbearing potential must have had a negative serum β-HCG pregnancy test
             (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) conducted during screening
             and a negative urine β-HCG pregnancy test conducted prior to study drug administration
             on Day -31. Ongoing serum pregnancy tests were conducted according to the study
             protocol.

             Nonsterilized male subjects who were sexually active with a female partner of
             childbearing potential must have used male condoms plus spermicide from screening
             through 90 days after last dose of durvalumab or through 6 months after the last dose
             of tremelimumab (whichever was longer). Female partners (of childbearing potential) of
             a male subject must have used a highly effective method of contraception throughout
             the period described above. Cessation of birth control after this point should have
             been discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual activity for the
             total duration of the trial and the drug washout period was an acceptable practice;
             however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method were not
             acceptable methods of contraception.

             Male subjects should have refrained from sperm donation throughout this period. A
             highly effective method of contraception was defined as one that resulted in a low
             failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Note
             that some contraception methods were not considered highly effective (e.g., male or
             female condom with or without spermicide; female cap, diaphragm, or sponge with or
             without spermicide; non-copper containing intrauterine device; progestogen-only oral
             hormonal contraceptive pills where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of
             action [excluding Cerazette/desogestrel which was considered highly effective]; and
             triphasic combined oral contraceptive pills).

         18. Any condition that, in the clinical judgment of the treating physician, was likely to
             prevent the subject from complying with any aspect of the protocol or that may have
             put the subject at unacceptable risk.

         19. Subjects must not have donated blood while on study and for at least 90 days following
             the last durvalumab treatment or for 6 months following the last tremelimumab
             treatment, whichever was longer.

                       rate < 1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone
                       contraception.

                    2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).

                    3. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                       suppository.

             In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill
             for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

             Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical
             profile. (e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical
             bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six
             weeks prior to screening. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the
             reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level
             assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.

         10. Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking drug
             and for 3 months after the last dose of study treatment. Male patients for 3 months
             should not father a child in this period. A condom is required to be used also by
             vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.

             was due to pancreatic disease.

         12. Patient has other severe, acute, or chronic medical conditions including uncontrolled
             diabetes mellitus or psychiatric conditions or laboratory abnormalities that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, may increase the risk associated with study participation
             or may interfere with the interpretation of study results.

         13. Patient has had major surgery (e.g., intra-thoracic, intra-abdominal or intra-pelvic)
             within 4 weeks prior to starting study treatment or has not recovered from side
             effects of such procedure. Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and mediastinoscopy
             will not be counted as major surgery and patients can receive study treatment ≥ 1 week
             after these procedures.

         14. History of another malignancy. Exception: Subjects who have been disease-free for 3
             years, or subjects with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer
             and/or subjects with indolent (early stage breast cancer or prostate cancer) second

             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with IPdR,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with IPdR. These
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study

          -  For stage 1 (all patients) and dose expansion (stage 2) endometrial and ovarian cancer
             cohorts, participants are allowed following unlimited prior therapy; for stage 2 GBM
             participants, no more than 2 prior relapses are allowed; for these patients, relapse
             is defined as progression following initial therapy (i.e. radiation +/- chemo if that
             was used as initial therapy) or a subsequent therapy; the intent therefore is that GBM
             patients enrolling onto stage 2 had no more than 3 prior therapies (initial and
             treatment for 2 relapses); if the patient had a surgical resection for relapsed
             disease and no anti-cancer therapy was instituted for up to 12 weeks, and the patient
             undergoes another surgical resection, this is considered to constitute 1 relapse
